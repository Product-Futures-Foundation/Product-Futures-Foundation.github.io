Personal property enables privacy.
Public property enables production.

You might say profit measures property misallocation.
Consider: When you own üêùs for üçØ, there is no sale.

of development.  The payment of profit should be allowed; it is only the misapplication of that payment that keeps each user from growing.  The trouble is a general form of usury caused by the misappropriation of profit by owners which then constructs the inverted incentive of artificial scarcity.  Non-profit corporations do not solve this problem either because the profit is still not treated as user investment, but is instead "turned into" wages or invested by the current owners in whatever way they see fit as so-called 'representatives' of the users instead of control flowing to those users as real ownership which would allow them to replace board members that attempted to overpay themselves and also implements direct democracy with vote weighted by holdings.


Q: May I charge money for Free Objects?
A: Yes, the GNU General Public Law is a "'commercial grade'" free (as in freedom) trade agreement.


Q: How much may I charge?
A: There is no limit.  Some sort of auction system might help maximize resource utilization to keep object prices above cost only during high demand.


Q: As an owner, how much of the price can I claim as costs (including wages)?
A: There is no limit.  Profit is separated from wages as the number of owners per physical source increases.  Workers are then hired by the collecitve owners explicitly instead of the labor being 'assumed' by some of the owners who may otherwise overpay themselves.


Q: Can I apply the GNU General Public Law to a physical source such as a rototiller and then rent it to customers?
A: Yes, in this case the 'Object' becomes the ephemeral 'Objective' of that User or the rivalrous slice of time as the duration of that rent.  Allowing users to bid against each other for time slots will maximize profit (the winning user's investment).


Q: So if a car factory were under such a contract, anyone could just wander in off the street and try to build their own automobile?
A: No, no.  Shareholders will protect their investments from strangers and/or vandals and normal wear as usual by requiring a rent floor be paid - even if the renter is a part owner, and may also require such things as tests or insurance to qualify.  The restrictions each group of owners impose over that particular physical source are arbitrary and there is no limit, but the currency issued against those physical sources will decrease as non-owning users assess those objects as being not worth the claimed costs.


Q: Why are you doing this, why not just maximize you own profit?
A: Because if we don't stop these profiteering feudalists they will eventually hire vassals to come take all of our resources for the purpose of stopping our production.  That is the ultimate problem with allowing any form of usury: it finally creates war to destroy capital for the purpose of further increasing usury.


Q: Why would owners tie their own hands in this way to forgo profit?
A: So the physical sources of production (such as land, water, plants, animals, buildings, tools) that they need for production are available to them without paying tribute to another.  It is the price we pay for freedom through cooperation.


Q: But isn't profit the prime motivator of human society?
A: Product is the only valid purpose of production.  A portion of price, interest and rent are initially meaningful and useful for reclaiming the labor expended, resources lent or opportunity lost, but these are almost always taken to far, and at the instant that an owner is paid just because they won't let the users have "at cost" access to the sources, they have begun 'earning' usury.  Most humans only expect to get paid for the work they do, but after they begin hiring employees, and as their business grows, the owners usually find there is much to be made (taken) by disallowing source access.  We must eliminate those externalizing actions before the beast destroys the entire earth in the name of progress.

2020-03-11:  4 Freedoms in a Material World:

. Use: You might just eat the apple.  Notice this is also a modification(1).

. Modify: You may mix the apple with other Free objects to make pie.  You may also steer future production, and so choose the way forward.

. Copy: If you paid more than production costs for the apple, you have paid what is traditionally known as 'profit'.  This DEED requires the seller treat that portion of your payment as YOUR investment in physical sources (an apple tree) and it's supporting sources (land, water rights, tools) needed for future production of more objects of that type (more 'copies' of those genetics).

. Share: You might sell or give the apple or pie to someone else.

If you share, sell, trade, give, or convey the Product, you must show the user their rights by 

Any amount you charge above cost must be treated as that new user's investment in trees, land, water rights, tools, etc.

Apply this contract to any Object (whether the Object is physical or virtual) to create Free (not zero cost) public utility for current and future users.  Treating some profit as payer investment insures physical sources are purchased and maintained for that User pays above the cost of production for the Object being traded.

At the point of sale, the part normally called `profit' is offered to the User as an investment in his name toward the physical Sources such as land, tools, buildings and plants which will be used to create more objects.

In this way every Object User becomes a competitor in production against other Object Users while also owning the physical sources of production with some of those same users.

Cars, computers, spaghetti and beer can be copied; you just need to own the physical sources and employ the workers.

This property left treaty is designed to localize and optimize users' freedom to govern their own physical sources of production.
