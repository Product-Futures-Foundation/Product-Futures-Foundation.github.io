We must use property ownership to reduce token-flow (use-value), not to increase token-flow (exchange-value).
Rent and profit do not exist when you own the sources because you need the product.
The Apple tree owner does not buy Apples, he owns them without purchase.

seems to view debt as a solution:
"Affordable home loans"
"Microloans for individual water and sewage improvements"

and promotes exchange-value instead of use-value
"investment advice for local teachers"
"share earnings from natural resources"

Imagine a #PrivateCity fully owned by those citizens, with vote weighted by the amount they own *but* when they own more than they use, most of the rent, interest or profit they collect must be treated as that payer’s investment - as a variation on the #HenryGeorge #LVT
