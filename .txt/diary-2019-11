2019-11-19: A 2-Token Economy

The first is a "Product Ticket" representing some future good or service, such as an 🍎 or 🚕 ride.

These tokens are are initially unusable and eventually expiring according to the real constraints of that product type and instance.

These tokens are issued and sold to secure the money and work required for that production.

The money is used to buy land, water-rights, tools, etc., while the work is used to complete that production.

The second token is a "Source Title" representing one_square_foot (ft²) of land plus a proportional bundle of finite resources such as water-rights, mineral-rights, according to total available on that planet.

The owner of this token owns the associated products without purchase.

These tokens must be handled with care to avoid the speculation identified by Henry George and Richard Stallman.

Sell future OUTPUTS (Goods and Services)
to buy the INPUTS (Land and Capital)
required for that production.
Then vest ownership of the INPUTS
to those who complete that work.

Ownership of INPUTS vest
to consumers of OUTPUTS
who pay with work
within the system.
