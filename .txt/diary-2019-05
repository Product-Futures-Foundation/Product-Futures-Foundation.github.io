Business Model:
Sell future products to buy the sources of production.
Then offer these sources for future work commitments.
And so acquire land, capital and labor without debt.
Hold this property For Product to stablize the system.

Conditions:
You agree to work in the future in return for:
1. The land, organisms and tools you need to wash, eat and sleep.
2. Others working for you in the future.  [[Optional but recommended]]

You will be among the first workers to help setup camp,
begin construction of the first shared structures,
install and tend flora, fauna, fungi in a perma+aqua+culture way.

Limitations:
During the bootup phase we might be sleeping in tents, using composting toilets, little hot water, only first aid, only shared cooking.

Inhabitants have permanent access to healthy food, shelter, and ample opportunities to learn, play, socialize and explore without the burden of unfulfilling or unsafe jobs, exchange, structural violence, or pollution.
