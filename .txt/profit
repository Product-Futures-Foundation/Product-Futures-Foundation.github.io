profit = price - cost

Rent is zero when owner occupied.

Profit is the difference between the real costs of production payed by the source-owners and the price charged against the product-consumer buying the final product.

Profit does not exist when the source-owner *is* the product-consumer who simply accepts that product as a sort of natural return on investment.

Profit and rent do not exist when the owner of inputs is the consumer of outputs.



Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent >> in owner-occupancy, the landlordâ€“tenant relationship is short-circuited. Consider a model: two people, A and B, each of whom owns property. If A lives in B's property, and B lives in A's, two financial transactions take place: each pays rent to the other. But if A and B are both owner-occupiers, no money changes hands even though the same economic relationships exists; there are still two owners and two occupiers, but the transactions between them no longer go through the market.
