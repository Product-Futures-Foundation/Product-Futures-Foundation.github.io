Sources are like the Means of Production within the immaterial realm.

Imagine IRL you buy an :apple: - but when you look at the receipt, it shows you now own a tiny amount of land which will be used to grow future :apple:s.

You will own those sources because you want that product.

If we write rules that 'reflect' some of profit back to the person who paid it, to insure users gain sources, and if that land can be held "For Product", we can regain control of that production and avoid paying profit for those products.

I am trying to describe how we can fine-tune our rules to be more self-regulating by requiring some of the value called profit be used to buy land. 

The reasoning is because profit and land are inversely related.

When you own land For Product, you do not pay profit, because there is no sale.  We can own :deciduous_tree: /in groups/ because we want :apple:.

When users own Sources, the hand becomes visible.
Choosing profit over product is the first mistake.

Attract middle-income Consumers to pre-pay for organic goods and services.

Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.
Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.

Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of workers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.

Attract Workers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, utilities, transportation, food, water, medicine, clothing, basic health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the current corporations and governments fail to achieve.

Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.
If we qualify as non-profit we might avoid Property taxes.

If you want the studio apartment, 3 minute showers, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.

If you want a 3-bedroom house, shares in the clubhouse and more elaborate meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor (or more valuable labor) in order to compensate others for the extra work and land and tools required for that production.

For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will eventually want co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other property such as land, barns, food crops, tools, etc. used to house and feed those organisms, and the things needed to create *those* inputs, recursively, through the entire tree of production.

Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of profit when selling surplus.

== Workflow
The vision of a future product is proposed.

Engineering constraints are enforced to find a realistic implementation or variation.

The scale and level of vertical integration are estimated, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.

A 'recipe' for that production is written, listing the required Sources and Skills.

Source Titles are issued, each representing a portion of those Sources.

Future products are then sold to purchase the real estate and tools and plants and animals on the open market.

Source Titles are then 'sold' to workers to secure the needed Skills.

Once we have enough commitments of Sources and Skills, we can begin production.

After the first round of production, products are distributed to each investor based on how they helped fund that production.

For example, "Dental Ensurance" requires co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry combined with promises of future labor from a qualified Dentist to fix your teeth in return for you working on his behalf somewhere else in the city, or on behalf of somebody else who will work on his behalf, and so on, to any depth.

Yes, it is a good point.  We need commitments.

We can use property-ownership and work-contracts to *bind* the land and labor required for the production of essential **future** goods and services we know we are going to need.

. Create User Interface to sell products and 'hire' workers.
. Find real-estate listings fit for ecosystem restoration.
. Issue 1 ***fungible*** coin for each square foot of each listing.
. Sell these coins to buy the land.
. Vest land ownership to those who complete work-contracts.
. These owners accept future products as the natural return on investment.
