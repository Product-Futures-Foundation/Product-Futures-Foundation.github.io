In the Local Tokens system, Alt Shares are "'Bundled transferable non activate prepaid subscriptions limited availability discounted pre-sales'"

In the For Product system, each Product Ticket represents a claim of ownership over the future production of a particular good or service at some projected quantity and quality.

Each Product Ticket is initially-invalid and finally expiring, with the "Window of Validity" defined by real limitations of production and storage.

During bootup, Product Tickets are issued and sold to buy the Sources required for that production.

After bootup, Product Tickets are periodically issued and deposited into the accounts of Source Title owners, representing the future products they *already* own.

We have designed the For Product business model to:
  Sell Future Products to fund the acquisition of land without debt.
  Vest property ownership of that land to those who complete that production.
  Constrain those owners by these terms of operation.
  Treat profit as the payer's investment when selling surplus products.

                Future Productions
We help groups buy, own and gov land to control the production they need.
These groups sell the Future Products they will make to buy raw land.
Workers become land owners as they complete that production.
Land owners are Future Product owners without late purchase.
Land owners govern using the For Product model and User Interface.
Workers implicitly trade future work when they buy Future Products.
Owners can split from groups while retaining their part of that land.
