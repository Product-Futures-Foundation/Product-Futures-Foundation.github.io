                Future Productions
We help groups buy, own and gov land to control the production they need.
These groups sell the Future Products they will make to buy raw land.
Workers become land owners as they complete that production.
Land owners are Future Product owners without late purchase.
Land owners govern using the For Product model and User Interface.
Workers implicitly trade future work when they buy Future Products.
Owners can split from groups while retaining their part of that land.
