Sanitation is a fundamental human need required for a healthy society.

==Dishes
Imagine a dishwasher with 4 half-trays in the machine that are easily removed.

Another 4 half-trays are placed near the sink so users can load their own dirty dishes instead of filling the sink.

After the current load is finished, the clean trays are replaced with the dirty trays with very little effort.


==Clothes
Multiple laundry chutes (3 to 5) let the user pre-sort clothes to avoid the need to sort later.

Each chute dumps into the washer when reaching a weight limit and if another load is not running.

The design of new washers can  not stuck as it empties into the dryer.

Dryer dumps into basket on counterbalanced dumb-waiter which returns to the user.



Also: attach dispensers to deliver configurable amount of soap with each wash.

==Walls, floors
