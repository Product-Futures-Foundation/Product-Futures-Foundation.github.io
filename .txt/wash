Sanitation is a fundamental human need required for a healthy society.

==Dishes
Imagine a dishwasher with 4 half-trays in the machine that are easily removed.

Another 4 half-trays are placed near the sink so users can load their own dirty dishes instead of filling the sink.

After the current load is finished, the clean trays are replaced with the dirty trays with very little effort.


==Clothes
Pre-sort: 'Whites', 'Colors', 'Delicate' small laundry baskets allows the early solution.

Once a weight limit is reached clothes, are dumped in small washer (with optional [confirm] button) - of course waiting if another load is in progress.

The washer is also the dryer?

Dry load dumps into basket on a counterbalanced dumb-waiter.

A vision-enabled and/or remote-controlled car could take it the last mile.

Large dispenser delivers a configurable amount and kind of soap for each wash.

==VaClean
Single-item washer will sanitize and dry most any cloth in seconds.

Design specs:
4 rollers approx 24 inches tall x 6 inches diameter.
2 mesh belts, each wrapping around 2 of the rollers.
