"'Mercury is somewhat similar to a cellular mobile network, it provides features similar to SMS, calls, data connections, push notifications, etc, but

built as an overlay network on top of any transport layer (currently Tcp but could use Tor, I2P, mesh, etc)
your own "cell tower" node can join or leave the network any time
selecting a "provider/cell" is the only trustful part of the system and can be changed any time
uses cryptographic keys instead of phone numbers to connect peer to peer, nodes and applications use the same kind of identity
user data and calls are encrypted, you cannot be spied on or be cheated with contact identity
you're free to keep your identity and contacts moving to another provider or application
supports you having different unrelated identities (family, professional, dating, etc) within the system
you can restore all your profiles from a "cold HD wallet" after lost/broken device
the network is extremely resilient, dies only with the last cell
built to support any kind of decentralized/distributed application on top'"
