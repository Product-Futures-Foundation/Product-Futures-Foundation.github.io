We can own property properly to make all we need.

Source Owners are Product Owners without sale.

You own products *automatically* when you own the Sources of those products.

For example, if you own a tree, you own all the fruit of that tree, even before it is produced.

You might even say you own all the *potential* production of those Sources.

The concept of "Intellectual Property" confuses the 'Type' of some thing with a single 'Instance' of that thing.

A particularly obvious example of this correlates stealing a purse with copying a movie.

But this ignores that you can also copy {the design of} a purse, and steal {the physical artifact required to store, such as a DVD, VHS, USB key, hard drive, etc.} a movie.
