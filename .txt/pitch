= Problem Statement
We must toil for coins to pay the rent.
This is how most of our lives are spent.

We do not control the production we need to thrive in our lives.
We have almost no voice in what is created or how it is created.

= Solution Proposal
Write a DAO, 3 Ledgers and a Coin to buy, control and record production.
The DAO sells coins to buy land, then vests that land to users who work.
Users prepay for goods and services to request that future production.
Users own that land to own those future products without purchase.
Users sign work contracts to bind their own future work as payment.

= Value Propositions:
Users who pay with money receive Future Production (rewards-based crowdfunders).
Users who pay with work receive Future Production AND some of the land used in that production.
Users drive Future Production when they prepay for goods and services.
As Users become Owners, there is no purchase, so price and cost are the same.
Traditional investors receive a percentage of profits if the DAO sells surplus.

= Vision:
 The DAO asks for real-estate listings for sale and issues 1 earthChange for each 1 square foot (ftÂ²) of each listing.
 Once all the Coins of a listing are sold, the DAO buys that Land and holds it for now.

 If Future Production is requested, the DAO asks for RECIPIES describing the Terms, Land, Work and Time required.

 Users who qualify may sign Work Agreements to pay for future production.
 The DAO vests Land Ownership to Users who complete Work Agreements.
 These Land Owners buy Future Production from each other through the DAO.

 When users own land For Product, they own those future goods without purchase.
 When users bind work For Product, they own those future services without purchase.

 The price they pay as consumers is the costs they paid as owners, and profit is undefined.

= Demo: Game

= Benefits:
Essential production is localized as groups regain control.

We can insure any good or service by binding land and work this way.

= Deliverables

Workers
own land so pay
rent or profit unless buying surplus.

= Market Share

= Business model
Surplus and profit schedules?

= Competition
Compare alternatives and highlight unique features?

= Go-to market
wut?

= Success Criteria
How many people are being housed and fed?

= Deadlines
plan/approach

= Team

= Traction
Speed of coin sales and land acquisition.
