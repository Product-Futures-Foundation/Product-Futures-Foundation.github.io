Earth Change is another way to govern the Property and Promises required to create the food, housing, sanitation, medical care, transportation, education we need.

Each Earth Change Title (ECT) is a semi-fungible deed of property ownership over the land and capital required for that production.  The proposed unit size is 1_ft².

As the DAO is fed requests for goods and services, it searches for the land, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to achieve those goals.

The DAO then issues and attempts to sell ECTs (each backed by a portion of that property) to buy that property and to pay those workers.

The DAO thereby constructs a series of privately owned permaculture-based cities directly controlled by those citizen-owners through sets of parallel, semi-continuous crowdfunding campaigns.

You may buy ECT with plain-old-money or with work commitments.

When paying with plain-old-money, you become a real owner in the property required for that production.  The return on investment is delayed by the nature of that production.

When paying with work commitments, you receive bundles of ECTs vesting as real property ownership in the Means of Production required to provide you with a Basic Outcome.

Especially during the pre-boot phase, on-site workers must also be provided immediate access to low-cost sanitation (solar-heated showers), food (bulk ingredients such as beans, grains, etc. used to make shared meals) and shelter (yurts, tents, tiny-houses).

Profit should be collected when selling surplus, but some percentage must be treated as an investment from the payer.

This "For Product" business model attracts investors to own the inputs because they want the outputs.

Property is used to "pre-distribute" products to those who predict they will need them and can afford to pay for them with time or money.


"'
    Just as the owner of a tree owns all of that fruit,
each co-owner of an orchard owns his portion of that fruit.
'"


The usual transaction of  consumer purchase is eliminated for those investors, for that product; so the price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the sale does not occur.

Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works.

The DAO collects requests for products, then calculates the property and promises required, then buys the property on the "open market" and also auctions the work to those who will accept ECT in lieu of traditional wages.

You may join with plain old money or by signing work-bonds (after proof of capability).

People prepaying for future products with plain-old-money or Promises (commitments of future work) become real owners of the Inputs required for that production.

When paying with Promises, property vests as that work is completed.

Investors own a percentage of future Products as a natural side-effect of owning the Property.

Owners may declare some of their Product as 'surplus' to be sold on the open market.

The DAO offers these products around market price and will likely gain profit will then treat some of that value as an investment from that payer, causing acquisition of even more property for those late payers, or to buy any property that may be for sale within the Earth Change metro.


==Limitations
Each Earth Change coin is the *projected* productive capacity of 1 square foot.

Selling each coin at 1$ would fund $43,560 per acre.

Farmland in the US is sold at around $12k/acre (reference?)

That leaves $31,560 left for startup costs of seeds, tools, tents, blankets, sanitation, bulk food staples, etc.

But some of the $ must buy land for the workers.


==Example
An example of a $1 Earth Change subscription would be 1_ft² piece of tomato plant land. On average 4,500 tomato plants can grow in an acre, a single tomato plant will start producing within a month and produce an avg of 20 pounds of tomatoes throughout the season. This means if the consumer pays a month early it’s $0.5 for a pound of tomatoes.

Timeline
==Pre-Boot
*Earth Change is a seed

Investor-Consumers commit money for seeds/tools/land to receive future product.

Worker-Owners commit to guiding seeds to future product to receive self sufficient land.


==Phase 2
*Earth Change begins growth

Once enough commitments are made, Worker-owners will move on site and start learning how self sufficiency works while also guiding the Investor-consumers seeds.


==Phase 3
*Earth Change starts flowering

As the first plants reach maturity and start fruiting, Investor-Consumers will receive their first rounds of production. Worker-owners no longer need training and can work on their own.


==Phase 4
*Earth Change flowers die and seeding occurs

After about 5 years the Worker-owners will have transformed into fully self sufficient beings, with their land payed off, they will no longer need the Investor-consumer’s investments. This creates a situation where Investor-consumers will have to migrate to other Worker-owners or evolve into Worker-owners themselves.

Todo
Different interfaces for each part of the system:
Employment portal for workers to learn, test and qualify for jobs and eventually sign Work Bonds.
Housing portal to find a place to live onsite (most workers will live onsite).
Consumer portal for customers prepaying for goods and services or buying surplus.
Investment portal for traditional investors seeking profit.
Donation portal for those who just want us to succeed.
Education portal to create and watch videos or articles.
