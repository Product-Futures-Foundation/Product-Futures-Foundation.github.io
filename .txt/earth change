Earth Change is yet another way for groups to control the products they need.

The Earth Change DAO helps consumers place orders for future goods and services to secure the Property and Promises required for that production.

Some users supply plain-old-money to buy the land and tools, while others commit to achieve the work required for that production.

Production must be diverse enough to supply food, shelter, sanitation, health-care, transportation, communication, etc. for all on-site owners.

Each investor attempts to own approximately the amount of sources (chickens, dental tools, cattle, bees) required to produce the amount of products (eggs, healthy teeth, milk, honey) they predict they will need in the future.

Unlike a cooperative, the owners do not buy the product from a central authority, but instead just claim the portion of those results that they already own.

The Earth Change Marketplace helps you supply traditional money or work in return for future products at some quality and rate after an initial startup delay caused by real-world constraints.

====Examples
. 16 oz of Grade B honey every month after delay of 9 to 12 months.
. Continuous and exclusive access to 300 ftÂ² studio apartment after delay of 4 to 6 months.
. 2 dental exams each year and all work required to maintain healthy teeth after delay of 4 to 6 months.

The DAO calculates the quality and quantity of the physical Sources (land, tools, organisms, etc.) required for that production, then searches the internet to buy those Sources.

The DAO thereby uses semi-automatic crowdfunding to acquisition the real-estate, tools, organisms, etc. required to make some product.

But since most production also requires human effort, the DAO must accept some payments in the form of work commitments.

In this way we can ensure the products we need without passing tokens.

                                ....


>>        Just as the owner of a tree owns all of that fruit,
>>    each co-owner of an orchard owns his portion of that fruit.


The Earth Change DAO issues Source Titles representing real property ownership in the land and tools used to accomplish that production.

The DAO searches for real estate for sale near that user, and also the price of tools and other required inputs to set the minimum bid price for each Source Title.

The DAO then issues Work Orders to gather the human effort required for that production.  Any person or group may apply for that work.

Finally the DAO issues Product Tickets representing the projected quality and quantity of each finished product, and deposits them into the accounts of each Source Title owner.

Once all the Source Titles are sold and all Work Orders filled, the property is purchased and production can begin.

This "For Product" business model attracts investors to own the inputs because they want the outputs.

Property ownership in Sources is used to "pre-distribute" the Product to each who predicted they would need it.

The usual transaction of consumer purchase is eliminated for those owners, for that product; so the price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the sale does not occur.

Owners of Sources own that same percentage of that future Product as a natural side-effect of owning those Sources.

Owners may sell surplus directly, and profit should be collected to inhibit middle-men, but some percentage must be treated as that payer's investment.

Subscriptions can be designed to let the DAO automatically auction surplus Product Tickets as their expiration date approaches.

Each owner must periodically cross-commit the inputs required for the ongoing costs of production for all of the outputs they expect, else lose some of that ownership to compensate co-owners for those costs.

For example, each co-owner of a dentist office must cross-commit the sources and promises needed to keep that office operational.

This usually just means you will commit to work somewhere in the system in return for those details resolved by the DAO to create a real alternative to traditional insurance.

Sources that are not yet products of vertical integration must be purchased from external sources, and yet we should also put effort into buying the sources of those sources so that we move closer and closer toward soverignty.

For example, we might buy feed for the cattle and chickens at first, but must plant alfalfa and grains to bring that production local.

We will incrementally target the more difficult products such as raising the plants or animals to retrieve fibers we will spin into thread, weave into cloth, cut and sew into our clothing.  We will buy wells and refineries to process crude oil into gasoline.  We will buy mines and forges to build heavy machinery.

The initial boot-up phase may require workers live in tents as they build the first permanent structures and prepare cafeteria meals from bulk purchases until the agriculture is productive enough.

We can eventually grow all the inputs required for food, soap, cloth, medicine, and building materials on site, but this could take years for some products so must buy off-the-shelf solutions for sanitation, shelter, food, clothing, first-aid, etc.


==Bootup
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site workers.

Estimate the sources and promises needed for that production and issue Source Titles toward those goals.

Sell about half of those Source Titles for traditional money, and the other half for commitments of future work.

Part of the Property must be the physical sources such as land, water, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to create and operate the Earth Change city.

The rest must be 'bootup' goods such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, first-aid kits, etc. needed to support workers until the agriculture is productive and before the permanent shelters are complete.

We may also need to secure commitments of some critical services that we cannot yet supply on-site such as advanced dental work, extended health care, long-distance travel, etc.

==Outline
Potential users pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic goods and services they need such as food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation, basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.

Some pre-pay with money used to buy property while others pre-pay with promises as commitments to complete the needed work.

After some amount of time, or some series of events [these conditions are currently unknown] the Source Titles should vest more fully to the payer, allowing him to sell the sources.

At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to secede (fork/split) from the group while retaining Property ownership.


==Commentary
Incorporating for Product - Investing for Goods
Let's make new corporations owned by the users of those products.
We will organize groups to co-buy the property needed for production.
We will organize workers to promise to work in the future in exchange for Source Titles.
Every investor (whether of property or of promises) becomes a real co-owner and receives the product itself as a natural return for those investments.  Each co-owner of the sources is co-owner of the products in that same amount.

That leaves profit to be treated as payer investment in more sources - to become the real property of that consumer - causing him to incrementally gain the ownership in property that will allow him to finally stop buying that product late, but instead pay the costs early and then own the product as a side-effect of his property ownership.

This auto-distributes ownership to those who pay for that growth.

In this way we treat profit as misallocated property that is 'reflected' back to the payer as ownership in sources.  This must not be a payout of product or a break on the price, for such do not create a functional negative-feedback loop.


==Another Outline
Attract middle-income Consumers to pre-pay for organic products and earth-friendly services.

Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of profit gathered during growth.

Hybrid Option: Attract corporations like Pepsi, Nike, etc. who fund projects for Public Relations purposes.

Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.

Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.

Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of workers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.

Attract Workers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, all utilities (electricity, gas, sewer, recycling), transportation, and even food, water, medicine, clothing, comprehensive health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the corporations and governments currently control instead of smaller groups.

Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.
Will want to qualify as non-profit to avoid Property taxes.

Each Investor (whether committing money or work) becomes a co-owner of some productive asset.

If you want the studio apartment, a 5 minute shower, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.

If you want a 5-bedroom house want to shares in the clubhouse and more difficult meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor in order to compensate others for the extra work and land and tools.

The DAO does not pay wages in the traditional sense, but that is ok since the worker *already owns* most of the goods and services he needs, so does not need to pass tokens.

We do not sell the Products (except Surplus) because all of that output is in the correct hands (is owned by those who will consume it) even before it is produced.


==Overview
Investors become co-owners according to the value they commit as measured by the others in that group.

Each co-owner of Property is the co-owner of Products even before production is complete.  You might say they each own their portion of all *potential* Products.  You do not buy the Product from the Earth Change DAO, but instead just claim that which is already yours.

For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will eventually want co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other property such as land, food, medicine, tools used to house and feed those organisms, and the things needed to create *those* inputs (plants, animals, tools), recursively, through the entire tree of production.


==Timeline
The vision of a future product is proposed.
Engineering constraints are enforced to find a realistic implementation or variation.
The scale and level of vertical integration are estimated, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.
A 'recipe' for that production is written, listing the required Property and Promises.
Source Titles are issued against that Property.
Some of these Source Titles are sold to purchase the real estate and tools and plants and animals on the open market.
The rest of these Source Titles are sold to secure the work commitments.
Once we have all the commitments of both Property and Promises, we can begin production.

After the first round of production, Products are distributed to each investor based on their percentage of ownership.

Owners with surplus Product may sell to non-owners to cover costs of production and Profit may be collected from the non-owners (as much as the market will bear), but some of that profit must be treated as that payer's investment, causing them to gain Source Titles.

Workers are consumers who receive ownership in the Property required to produce the Products they need.

For example, "Dental Ensurance" requires co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry combined with promises of future labor from a qualified Dentist to fix your teeth in return for you working on his behalf somewhere else in the city, or on behalf of somebody else who will work on his behalf, and so on, to any depth.

Promising to work *before* production begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owners of the Property own their % of the Product *already*, even before they are produced.  This is "Predictive Barter" - where we Property and Promises are preallocated to those who need the Products.

A functional Earth Change system will require enough "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to 'pay' each other without needing to pass tokens.  For example, after we build a dentist office and buy the tools for simple dental procedures, we must attract or train some people that can operate those tools, and who are willing to commit to do that work for the 'pay' of gaining co-ownership in the property for housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate that property for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.  Notice this fully replaces traditional insurance.

Vertical Integration increases local sovereignty by reducing the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we will buy grains and alfalfa at first to feed our chickens and cattle, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.  Absolute Vertical Integration is a very long-term goal.  We won't co-own mines or factories right away, so can just buy off-the-shelf tools while we are 'booting'.

If each coin represents 1 square foot, selling at 1$ would fund $43,560 per acre.
Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works.
