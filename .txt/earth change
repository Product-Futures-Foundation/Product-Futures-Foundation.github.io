= EARTH CHANGE
Earth Change is a GNU way to organize material production
to alter the flow of value towards regenerative abundance.

We are building a token and DAO to acquire and manage
the sources and skills required for the production
of critical goods and services like food and home.

Potential members commit either work or money toward
future production through the DAO interface.

Once enough money and work commitments are recorded,
we buy the sources, such as land, tools, water-rights.

Members become co-owners in the sources required for that production
and accept the product itself as the natural return on that investment.

>> When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
>> Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
>> when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
>> You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

== Timeline
Future products are sold to buy sources required to begin production.
Some of these sources are sold for commitments to work in the future.
Owners accept the Product itself as the natural return on investment.
Owners sell Surplus Product but some profit becomes payer investment.

Search real estate listings to meet the many requirements such as minimum size, maximum price, fitness for permaculture, zoning restrictions, water rights, mineral rights, taxes, fees, etc.

Finalize parcel selection and begin minting tokens representing those sources.

Sell tokens to workers and other investors.

Reach some agreement over general structure of the city such as a central meeting place, major roads, nature preserves, strict borders, pollution restrictions, and any other constraints this group may decide to enforce upon itself.

Reach agreement over the general structure of the city such as a central meeting place, major roads, nature preserves, strict borders, pollution restrictions, and any other constraints this group may decide to enforce upon itself.

Purchase land, tools and startup supplies, including primary bulk food ingredients such as bushels of grains, legumes, raw potatoes, bales of herbs and spices etc. to cook large, cheap but nutritious shared meals and begin soap and cloth making.

Any worker may move onsite immediately, but will likely be in tents with temporary sanitation facilities and cafeteria style dining while the first shared structures are built and support systems are established.

City supports a basic quality of life without external trade.
Begin building private structures such as tiny houses.
Install slower maturing plants and animals.

== What are the rules?
. Money becomes Sources: Consumers gain sources when they buy future products.
. Promises become Sources: Workers gain sources as they fulfill work promises.
. Sources become Product: Owners of sources are also owners of future products.
. Profit becomes Sources: Consumers gain sources when they buy surplus products.

=== Money becomes Sources
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for future products with traditional money, but instead of just receiving one round of production, they become the real property owners of the land and tools that will be purchased for that production.

These investors take risk to avoid paying the profit they would otherwise pay when buying that product on the open market.

=== Promises become Sources
Every worker is a consumer who needs source ownership for the same reasons.
These crowdfunders pay with promises of future labor.
Workers gain immediate access to sources which vest as work is complete.
Vested sources become collateral to access even more valuable sources.

=== Sources become Product
Source owners accept the product itself as the direct and natural return on investment, and so do not sell or buy the finished product (except surplus as explained below).

Instead of selling the product, it has been 'pre-distributed' to the consumer who predicted they would need it.  There is no sale because it is already the individuated property of that owner.

This allows these groups to operate at zero profit even while all those special shareholders who avoid paying profit for that product.

=== Profit becomes Sources
Any owner may sell surplus product and even collect profit, but some of that profit must be invested for that very same paying user to buy newly issued Source Titles, or to buy Source Titles being offered for sale by other owners.

This causes all users to incrementally gain the property ownership in the sources required to finally also control the production they need and receive those products at cost.

== Invitation
​We are looking for people to manage food production, and other supporting services such as food preparation etc.

We also need developers to help write the Solidity contracts and the DAO to mint the coin and facilitate planning.

== Definitions
=== Products
Each owner of Sources is owner of future Product in that same ratio.

For example, if you own 3% of the hives, you own 3% of the future honey.

Each Product instance has a window-of-validity in time enforced by constraints on production and on the lifetime of the product.

For example, a young tree does not produce fruit immediately, and the fruit is not fresh forever.

Property may not fully vest to workers if quality or quantity projections are not met.  Projections must be adjusted for reasons outside the worker’s control such as such as severe weather, fire, earthquake, accidents, etc.

=== Sources
Those paying with traditional money for “1 Gallon of milk per month” must pay the market-price of the land, tools, cattle, water rights, etc., recursively, for all that production.

But that is only *part* of the cost.  The other cost is human labor.

So those paying with traditional money are implicitly also buying the ECTs used to compensate workers for one round of production.

Each owner must pay initial and recurring costs of production in one of these ways:
. Supply Sources or Promises for your portion of the costs of production for this group.
. Supply Sources or Promises for your portion of the costs of production through another group which has a trade agreement with this group, and recursively, to any depth.
. Sell (or allow to be sold) enough of your Product to cover the costs of production.
. Secede from the group and retain your portion of the sources under your own terms (within the limits of realistic divisibility).

A variety of city design templates following permaculture principles could help guide core decisions around borders, roads, shared structures, etc.

For the health and safety of all citizens, every citizen on site must receive at least enough tokens to ensure Tier0 quality of life.

===Promises
Promises are commitments of future work.

Work is auctioned with payout increasing as the crowdfund end date approaches.  So more difficult or less fun jobs receive higher pay.

Each group must insure every worker is qualified

ECTs purchased with work commitments vest incrementally, as that work is completed.

Trading work early in time, before production begins, allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the “simultaneous coincidence of wants” problem that faces typical barter.

This creates a real and direct insurance for each good and service produced in this way and inverts the usual incentives of scarcity and destruction toward the natural goals of abundance and permanent solutions.

This contrasts with the regular market where mechanics, plumbers and dentists need customers with broken cars, pipes, teeth to insure tokens continue to flow.

When workers commit early to apply any work needed in the future, they hope you never have any trouble at all, since they have received your commitments either way.

Work is returned to it’s natural position as a problem to minimize instead of being a confused as goal itself.

Automation and robots can be used to safely reduce work in this scenario because each group only wants the results.

A guild system could train and test workers and protect owners by insuring quality levels and spreading fulfillment risks across many workers.


===Profit
Any owner may sell any amount of product at any price, but some percentage of that profit must be treated as the payer's investment by purchasing ECTs for that payer and giving those ECTs to that payer.

This safely reduces Profit within the system as the Sources required for production are incrementally redistributed to the consumers who need the results.


== Startup
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site workers.

Estimate the sources and promises needed for that production and issue ECTs toward those goals.

Sell about half of those ECTs for traditional money, and the other half for commitments of future work.

Part of the property must be the land, water, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. needed to create and operate the Earth Change city.

The rest must be 'bootup' goods such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, first-aid kits, etc. needed to support workers until the agriculture is productive and before the permanent shelters are complete.

We may also need to secure commitments of some critical services that we cannot yet supply on-site such as advanced dental work, extended health care, long-distance travel, etc.

== Finance
Investment Types (3 ways to pay)
1. Pay with commitments of traditional money to crowdfund the debt-free
 purchase of real estate and tools from the regular market.

2. Pay with commitments to work in the future for others within the city.
 This cause you, the worker, to receive immediate access to enough
 ECTs to sustain at least Tier0 quality of life.
 Vesting occurs as promises are kept, causing all workers to gain
 debt-free housing and food security.

3. Pay in a sort of ‘accidental’ way when you buy surplus product
 from other owners and pay more than the real costs of production.
 Owners selling surplus are required to buy ECTs with
 some of their profits, and vest ownership of those titles to you,
 the payer.

Potential users pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic goods and services they need such as food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation, basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.

Some pre-pay with traditional money buy the land and tools while others pre-pay by commiting to complete the needed work.

After some amount of time, or some series of events [these conditions are currently unknown] the ECTs should vest more fully to the payer, allowing him to eventually sell them or negotiate with other co-owners to rezone the property.

At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to secede (fork/split) from the group while retaining Property ownership.

Every investor (whether of sources or skills) becomes a real co-owner and receives the product itself as a natural return for those investments.  Each co-owner of the sources is co-owner of the products in that same amount.

That leaves profit to be treated as payer investment in more sources - to become the real property of that consumer - causing him to incrementally gain the ownership in sources required to finally stop buying that product late, but instead pay the costs early and then own the product as a side-effect of owning the sources.

This auto-distributes ownership to those who pay for that growth.

In this way we treat profit as misallocated property that is 'reflected' back to the buyer as ownership in sources.  This investment in sources must not be replaced by giving the buyer extra product or as a lowered price, for such do not create the negative-feedback loop required to help consumers escape owner domination.


== Strategy
Attract middle-income Consumers to pre-pay for organic goods and services.

Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.
Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.
Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of workers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.

Attract Workers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, utilities, transportation, food, water, medicine, clothing, basic health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the current corporations and governments fail to achieve.

Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.
If we qualify as non-profit we might avoid Property taxes.
Each Investor (whether money or work) becomes a co-owner.

If you want the studio apartment, 3 minute showers, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.

If you want a 3-bedroom house, shares in the clubhouse and more elaborate meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor (or more valuable labor) in order to compensate others for the extra work and land and tools required for that production.

For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will eventually want co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other property such as land, barns, food crops, tools, etc. used to house and feed those organisms, and the things needed to create *those* inputs, recursively, through the entire tree of production.

Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of profit when selling surplus.

== Workflow
=== DAO Interface
. Define a new product [Teach the DAO which sources are required for that production.]
. Buy a future product. [Prepay for a product and receive source ownership.]
. Sell a future product. [This is how you commit future work.  You must 'qualify' to access the sources of that production.  Source owners may impose any arbitrary requirement for access.]

=== Use cases
Vision of a future product is proposed.
Engineering constraints are enforced to find a realistic implementation or variation.
The scale and level of vertical integration are estimated, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.
A 'recipe' for that production is written, listing the required sources and skills.
ECTs are issued against those sources.
Some of these ECTs are sold to purchase the real estate and tools and plants and animals on the open market.
The rest of these ECTs are sold to secure the work commitments.
Once we have all the commitments of sources and skills, we can begin production.

After the first round of production, Products are distributed to each investor based on their percentage of ownership.

For example, "Dental Ensurance" requires co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry combined with promises of future labor from a qualified Dentist to fix your teeth in return for you working on his behalf somewhere else in the city, or on behalf of somebody else who will work on his behalf, and so on, to any depth.

Promising to work *before* production begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owner of sources is the owner of that % of product even *before* it is produced.  This is "Predictive Barter" - where sources and skills are used to preallocate products to those who will consume them.

A functional Earth Change system will require enough "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to 'pay' each other without needing to pass tokens.  For example, after we build a dentist office and buy the tools for simple dental procedures, we must attract or train some people that can operate those tools, and who are willing to commit to do that work for the 'pay' of gaining co-ownership in the property for housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate that property for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.  Notice this fully replaces traditional insurance.

Vertical Integration increases local sovereignty by reducing the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we might buy feed for our chickens and cattle at first, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.  We won't co-own mines or factories right away, so will just buy off-the-shelf tools while we are 'booting'.

=Notes
We use property ownership in the INPUTS to "pre-distribute" the OUTPUTS to those who predicted they would need them.

The usual transaction of consumer purchase is eliminated for those owners, for that product.  The price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the final sale does not occur - it has been imputed.

Each source owner is a product owner in that same amount.

Owners may sell surplus, and profit should be collected to inhibit middle-men, but some percentage of profit must be treated as that payer's investment to insure consumers gain the sources required to also escape usury.

To increase utilization, Product Tickets could be designed to automatically enter auction and be sold before expiration.

Each owner must periodically cross-commit the inputs required for the ongoing costs of production for all of the outputs they expect, else lose some of that ownership to compensate other co-owners for those costs.

For example, each co-owner of a dentist office must cross-commit the sources and skills needed to keep the office operational.

This usually just means you will commit to work somewhere in the system to buy the products you need, with the DAO resolving all the details about the sources and skills required for that production.

Products that are not yet produced on-site must be purchased from external vendors while we also try to buy the sources of those products to vertically integrate and move closer toward productive sovereignty.

For example, we might buy feed for cattle and chickens at first,
but would also start growing those plants to localize that production.

The initial boot-up phase may require workers live in tents as they build the first permanent structures and prepare cafeteria meals from bulk purchases until the agriculture is productive enough.

We can eventually grow all the inputs required for food, soap, cloth, medicine, and building materials on site, but this could take years for some products so initially must buy off-the-shelf solutions for sanitation, shelter, food, clothing, first-aid, etc.

==Notes
ECTs sold at $1/ft² supply $43,650/acre to buy the land, tools and work (workers are paid with ECTs, never directly with $).
Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works (parallel, semi-continuous crowdfunding campaigns).
