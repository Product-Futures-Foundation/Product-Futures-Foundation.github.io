==Old rough draft
This is yet another attempt to share the property and promises required to continuously recreate the goods and services we need.

We propose a GNU Mode of Production as a remixing of the rules of governance over the property and promises used to create the food, housing, sanitation, medical care, transportation, education, etc. we need.

Each Earth Change Title (ECT) is a semi-fungible deed of property ownership over the land and capital required for that production.

The DAO is fed plans for the proposed structural layout of a new city.
searches real-estate listings and tools for sale, then issues and attempts to sell ECTs to fund those purchases.

This should create a series of permaculture-based cities controlled directly by those citizen-owners through sets of semi-continuous crowdfunding campaigns.

Workers receive bundles of ECTs vesting as real property ownership in the Means of Production required to provide them with a Basic Outcome.

Profit should be collected when selling surplus, but then (at least part of it) treated as an investment from the payer.

This investment model is called "For Product", meaning you own the INPUTS because you want the OUTPUTS.  In this way we use property to "pre allocate" products to those who can predict they will need them.

    Just as the owner of a tree owns all of that fruit,
each co-owner of an orchard owns his portion of that fruit.

The usual transaction of  consumer purchase is eliminated for those investors for that product, so the price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the sale does not occur.

Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works.

The DAO collects requests for products, then calculates the property and promises required, then buys the property on the "open market" and auctions the work to those who will accept ECT in lieu of traditional wages.

You may join with plain old money or by signing work-bonds (after proof of capability).

People prepaying for future products (with work commitments or with money) become real owners of the Inputs required for that production.

These special investors also own the future Outputs as a natural side-effect of owning the Inputs.

People buying surplus products in the usual ‘late’ way will likely pay profit, but the DAO requires some of that value be used to acquire property for those late payers.

For example if someone were to buy a surplus apple, some of their money would go towards producing apples for themselves. Each time they buy an apple, they receive part of a *new* apple orchard, thereby eventually also receiving apples at cost.


Limitations
Selling each coin at 1$ would fund $43,560 per acre.

Each Earth Change coin is the *projected* productive capacity of 1 square foot.

Farmland in the US is sold at around $12k/acre (reference?)

That leaves $31,560 left for startup costs of seeds, tools, tents, blankets, sanitation, bulk food staples, etc.

But some of the $ must buy land for the workers. (clarify)


Example
An example of a $1 Earth Change subscription would be 1_ft² piece of tomato plant land. On average 4,500 tomato plants can grow in an acre, a single tomato plant will start producing within a month and produce an avg of 20 pounds of tomatoes throughout the season. This means if the consumer pays a month early it’s $0.5 for a pound of tomatoes.

Timeline
Pre-Phase
*Earth Change is a seed

Investor-Consumers commit money for seeds/tools/land to receive future product.

Worker-Owners commit to guiding seeds to future product to receive self sufficient land.


Phase 2
*Earth Change begins growth

Once enough commitments are made, Worker-owners will move on site and start learning how self sufficiency works while also guiding the Investor-consumers seeds.


Phase 3
*Earth Change starts flowering

As the first plants reach maturity and start fruiting, Investor-Consumers will receive their first rounds of production. Worker-owners no longer need training and can work on their own.


Phase 4
*Earth Change flowers die and seeding occurs

After about 5 years the Worker-owners will have transformed into fully self sufficient beings, with their land payed off, they will no longer need the Investor-consumer’s investments. This creates a situation where Investor-consumers will have to migrate to other Worker-owners or evolve into Worker-owners themselves.

Todo
Different interfaces for each part of the system:
Employment portal for workers to learn, test and qualify for jobs and eventually sign Work Bonds.
Housing portal to find a place to live onsite (most workers will live onsite).
Consumer portal for customers prepaying for goods and services or buying surplus.
Investment portal for traditional investors seeking profit.
Donation portal for those who just want us to succeed.
Education portal to create and watch videos or articles.
