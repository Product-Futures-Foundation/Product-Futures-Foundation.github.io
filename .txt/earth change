Earth Change is yet another way for groups to control the Goods and Services they need.

The Earth Change DAO interface lets you buy a subscription at some quality and rate (quantity/time) after an initial startup delay caused by real-world constraints.

====Examples
. 16 oz of Grade B honey every month after delay of 9 to 12 months.
. Continuous and exclusive access to 300 ft² studio apartment after delay of 4 to 6 months.
. 2 dental exams each year and all work required to maintain healthy teeth after delay of 4 to 6 months.

The DAO calculates the quality and quantity of the physical Sources (land, tools, organisms, etc.) required for that production, then searches the internet to buy those Sources.

The DAO thereby uses semi-automatic crowdfunding to acquisition the real-estate, hives, bees and other tools required to make honey.

But since most production also requires human effort, the DAO must accept some payments in the form of work commitments.

This means some users pay with plain-old-money which will be used to secure the Sources, while others users pay by agreeing to work to secure the Skills.

The work may be for that exact good or service, or for any other group using the Earth Change system as long as the chain-of-exchange can be resolved.

In this way any user can ensure the goods and services they need without resorting to token passing.


>>        Just as the owner of a tree owns all of that fruit,
>>    each co-owner of an orchard owns his portion of that fruit.


The Earth Change DAO issues "Source Titles" representing real property ownership in the land and tools used to accomplish that production.

The DAO searches for real estate for sale near that user, and also the price of tools and other required inputs to set the minimum bid price for each Source Title.

Once all the Source Titles are sold, the property is purchased and production can begin.

The DAO then issues "Work Orders" to gather the human effort required for that production.  Any person or group may apply for that work.

Finally, the DAO issues "Good Tickets", representing the projected quality and quantity of each finished product, and deposits these Tickets into the accounts of each Source Title owner.

The DAO thereby constructs a series of privately owned permaculture-based groups directly controlled by those co-owners through parallel, semi-continuous crowdfunding campaigns.

Especially during the pre-boot phase, on-site workers must also be provided immediate access to low-cost sanitation (solar-heated showers), food (bulk ingredients such as beans, grains, etc. used to make shared meals) and shelter (yurts, tents, tiny-houses).

Profit should be collected when selling surplus, but some percentage must be treated as an investment from the payer.

This "For Product" business model attracts investors to own the inputs because they want the outputs.

We use Property ownership in Sources to "pre-distribute" the Product to each who predicted they would need it.

The usual transaction of  consumer purchase is eliminated for those investors, for that product; so the price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the sale does not occur.

Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works.

The DAO collects requests for products, then calculates the property and promises required, then buys the property on the "open market" and also auctions the work to those who will accept ECT in lieu of traditional wages.

You may join with plain old money or by signing work-bonds (after proof of capability).

People prepaying for future products with plain-old-money or Promises (commitments of future work) become real owners of the Inputs required for that production.

When paying with Promises, property vests as that work is completed.

Owners of Sources own that same percentage of the future Products as a natural side-effect of owning those Sources.

Owners may declare some of their Product as 'surplus' to be sold on the open market.

The DAO offers these products around market price and will likely gain profit will then treat some of that value as an investment from that payer, causing acquisition of even more property for those late payers, or to buy any property that may be for sale within the Earth Change metro.


==Limitations
Each Earth Change coin is the *projected* productive capacity of 1 square foot.

Selling each coin at 1$ would fund $43,560 per acre.


==Pre-Boot
*Earth Change is a seed

Investor-Consumers commit money for seeds/tools/land to receive future product.

Worker-Owners commit to guiding seeds to future product to receive self sufficient land.


==Phase 2
*Earth Change begins growth

Once enough commitments are made, Worker-owners will move on site and start learning how self sufficiency works while also guiding the Investor-consumers seeds.


==Phase 3
*Earth Change starts flowering

As the first plants reach maturity and start fruiting, Investor-Consumers will receive their first rounds of production. Worker-owners no longer need training and can work on their own.


==Phase 4
*Earth Change flowers die and seeding occurs

After about 5 years the Worker-owners will have transformed into fully self sufficient beings, with their land payed off, they will no longer need the Investor-consumer’s investments. This creates a situation where Investor-consumers will have to migrate to other Worker-owners or evolve into Worker-owners themselves.

Todo
Different interfaces for each part of the system:
Employment portal for workers to learn, test and qualify for jobs and eventually sign Work Bonds.
Housing portal to find a place to live onsite (most workers will live onsite).
Consumer portal for customers prepaying for goods and services or buying surplus.
Investment portal for traditional investors seeking profit.
Donation portal for those who just want us to succeed.
Education portal to create and watch videos or articles.
