Earth Change is yet another way for groups to control the products they need.

The Earth Change Marketplace helps you supply traditional money or work for future products at some quality and rate after an initial startup delay caused by real-world constraints.

====Examples
. 16 oz of Grade B honey every month after delay of 9 to 12 months.
. Continuous and exclusive access to 300 ftÂ² studio apartment after delay of 4 to 6 months.
. 2 dental exams each year and all work required to maintain healthy teeth after delay of 4 to 6 months.

The DAO calculates the quality and quantity of the physical Sources (land, tools, organisms, etc.) required for that production, then searches the internet to buy those Sources.

The DAO thereby uses semi-automatic crowdfunding to acquisition the real-estate, tools, organisms, etc. required to make some product.

But since most production also requires human effort, the DAO must accept some payments in the form of work commitments.

In this way we can ensure the products we need without passing tokens.

                                ....


>>        Just as the owner of a tree owns all of that fruit,
>>    each co-owner of an orchard owns his portion of that fruit.


The Earth Change DAO issues "Source Titles" representing real property ownership in the land and tools used to accomplish that production.

The DAO searches for real estate for sale near that user, and also the price of tools and other required inputs to set the minimum bid price for each Source Title.

The DAO then issues Work Orders to gather the human effort required for that production.  Any person or group may apply for that work.

Finally, the DAO issues Product Tickets, representing the projected quality and quantity of each finished product, and deposits these Product Tickets into the accounts of each Source Title owner.

Once all the Source Titles are sold and all Work Orders filled, the property is purchased and production can begin.

This "For Product" business model attracts investors to own the inputs because they want the outputs.

Property ownership in Sources is used to "pre-distribute" the Product to each who predicted they would need it.

The usual transaction of consumer purchase is eliminated for those owners, for that product; so the price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the sale does not occur.

Owners of Sources own that same percentage of that future Product as a natural side-effect of owning those Sources.

Owners may sell surplus directly, and profit should be collected to inhibit middle-men, but some percentage must be treated as that payer's investment.

Subscriptions can be designed to let the DAO automatically auction surplus Product Tickets as their expiration date approaches.

Since most coins are not backed by anything of value,they use consensus in an  attempt to control the validity of transactions stored on the chain and to control issuance.

==Todo
Part of the system:
Employment portal for workers to learn, test and qualify for jobs and eventually sign Work Bonds.
Housing portal to find a place to live on-site.
Customer portal for those prepaying for products or buying surplus.
Investment portal for traditional investors seeking profit.
Donation portal for those who just want us to succeed.
Education portal to create and watch videos or articles.

==Notes
If each coin represents 1 square foot, selling at 1$ would fund $43,560 per acre.
Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works.
