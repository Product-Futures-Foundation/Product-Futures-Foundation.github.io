Everyone and every thing,
even 🐸 needs
space and care.

Could we make a "self-hosted" DAO
that buys land and tools
as we feed it money and work?

Undeveloped land is < 1$/square_foot.

...

If we treat Product as ROI,
we can avoid paying Profit.

If we commit Skills early,
we can achieve goals
without moving tokens.

2019-09-20: Wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics) >> A major question that has eluded economists since the earliest of publications was one of price.  As commodities began to be exchanged for currency, economic thinkers have constantly been trying to decipher how prices are determined.

2019-09-20:
When groups try to scale in size and complexity,
new users often receive much less control
than the current owners.

If owners charge profit against those new users,
they are, by definition, receiving more than cost.

If owners use that profit to buy more property,
they now have even more ownership and control.

In this way we see "Capital Accumulation" is
a natural side-effect of how we treat profit.

Treating profit as the payer's investment
makes the payer gain property in sources.

As the payer gains source ownership,
they regain control of production.

This negative-feedback loop
reduces consumer dependence
and minimizes profit.

I have found another approach
which yields an 'inverted' ROI,
but requires every investor be a consumer,
and each only invest about as much as needed
to create the amount of product that consumer
predicts he will need in the future.

The value prop here is to *avoid* paying rent.

Hi all,

Just joined and excited to share my findings on the very real feasibility of land acquisition.

Undeveloped land in the US can be found for less that $1/ft²

For example,
$1,850,000 for 250 acres at https://LandAndFarm.com/property/Meadowview_Ranch-9373344

That’s $7,400 per acre
With 43,560 ft² we have
250 * 43560 = 10890000 ft²
or about 20¢ per ft²

Hi all,

Excited to find this platform!

I have been developing with C and C++ since the middle 90's.

I would like to write Smart Contracts with Solidity and make that
process easy enough for anyone to read and write those documents.

Why?

Out of curiosity I began trying to 'debug' the economy, hoping
to find why we have no control of corporations or governments.

I eventually uncovered a set of 'rules' that allow us to form
new corporations that:

. Are owned and controlled by the people that need that production.
. Pre-allocate goods and services to those special shareholders without sale.
. Deliver those goods and services at the real costs of production.
. Can operate at zero profit even while shareholders remain satisfied.
. Do not seek profit, and so do not benefit during market scarcity.
. Use customer commitments to vet new products before production begins.
. Use customer commitments to secure interest-free funding for viable products. (like crowd-funding, but actually crowd-owning)
. Insure workers gain the land and tools required for a Basic Outcome.
. Make it easy to trade future work without passing tokens.
. Creates a direct but imperfect 'insurance' for any good or service.

The UI could be like:
[[Define New Product]] : Teach DAO all Sources required for that production.
[[Buy Future Product]] : Prepay for a product and receive Source ownership if paying with 🏃.
[[Sell Future Product]] : Commit to apply future 🏃 and receive Source ownership.

Source owners may impose any arbitrary access restriction against 🏃s.

When someone attempts to [[Buy Future Product]] the DAO adds to:
1. A pool of $ commitments to buy land, tools, plants, animals, water rights, fees...
2. A pool of 🏃 commitments to install, operate and maintain those Sources.

Once sufficient $ and 🏃 have been gathered, the DAO buys the Sources and alerts 🏃 to begin production.
