The UI could be like:
[[Define New Product]] : Teach DAO all Sources required for that production.
[[Buy Future Product]] : Prepay for a product and receive Source ownership.
[[Sell Future Product]] : Commit to future 🏃 and receive Source ownership.

Source owners may impose any arbitrary access restriction against 🏃s.

When someone attempts to [[Buy Future Product]] the DAO adds to:
1. A pool of $ commitments to buy land, tools, plants, animals, water rights, fees...
2. A pool of 🏃 commitments to install, operate and maintain those Sources.

Once sufficient $ and 🏃 have been gathered, the DAO buys the Sources and alerts 🏃 to begin production.
