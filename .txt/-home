Remixing ancient knowledge to buy, own and share property in a GNU way.


==                3 NFTs: Products Sources and Work .
Product Tickets🎫 represent future goods or services.
Source Titles▦ represent the land and tools required to produce those future products.
Work Agreements📃 are voluntary labor contracts and the only way to buy Source Titles▦.

                When you own 🐝s For Product,
                you own 🍯 before it is made.

==                Timeline
Issue Product Tickets🎫 to trade for money to buy Sources without debt.
Issue Source Titles▦ to trade for the Work required for that production.
Vest Source Titles▦ to those who complete Work Agreements📃.


==                Terms
Consumers buy Product Tickets🎫 to fund future production without debt.
Workers gain immediate access to the Sources required for a Basic Outcome.
Workers become Source Title▦ owners as they complete Work Agreements📃.
The owner of Sources is the automatic owner of those future products.


==                Owning Sources For Product
Instead of buying product from the group, each Source Owner claims their part directly.
Profit is UNDEFINED because the final transaction of purchase simply does not occur.
Even if someone else (or 🤖) does the work, ownership of the product does not change.

.    When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
.    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
.    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
.    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

==                Benefits
Groups of groups produce a "Basic Outcome" so you have:
1. A place and soap to wash your body and clothes.
2. Healthy, natural, clean food and water.
3. A clean and private place to sleep.
4. Instructions to stay healthy.

Workers gain property ownership in the Sources of the products they use,
and so receive all goods and services "at cost" and under their control.


==                 Results
When we sell future products to own source and trade work this way,
we create an imperfect insurance of that future production.

As the investor's interest is refocused on the product,
abundance returns as the true purpose of production
while automation and 🤖 are no longer a threat.
