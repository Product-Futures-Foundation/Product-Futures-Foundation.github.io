Product Ticketsüé´ represent future products and can be bought with traditional money.

Source Titles‚ñ¶ represent the land and tools required to produce those future products and can only be acquired by completing Work Agreements.

Work AgreementsüìÉ are legally-binding labor contracts meeting all local bonding and insurance requirements.


==                TIMELINE
Sell Product Ticketsüé´ to buy the land, tools and startup supplies without debt.

Issue Source Titles‚ñ¶ for the future work required for that production.

Exchange Work AgreementsüìÉ for Source Titles‚ñ¶ and the implicit Product Ticketsüé´.

Exchange rates between these coins set the price for each.

This creates a true insurance of pre-allocated goods and services.

Sell surplus at a profit to avoid resellers and insure each user gains the Source Titles‚ñ¶ required to stablize the system.

Instead of each buying the product from the collective others, each portion is directly claimed by each source co-owner.

    When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

"'
    When you own üêùs For Product,
    you own üçØ before it is made.
'"

Profit is UNDEFINED because the final transaction of purchase does not occur.

Even if someone else (or ü§ñ) does the work, ownership of the product does not change.

As a For Product property owner, you accept the product itself as the natural return on investment.

You own the same portion of the product as you own of land and tools required for that production.

Workers gain property as they complete production and so remain debt free.

Like crowdfunding, it brings sales to the beginning of the production chain.

But the crowd becomes the owners and accept the product itself as the natural ROI.

Workers who promise future labor receive immediate access to debt-free property which vests incrementally as they fulfill those promises.

Any co-owner may decide any amount of the product they own is more than they want, and so declare it as surplus product to be sold to other consumers with insufficient ownership.

The price of surplus is set by the market, but some amount of profit gained in this way must be treated as an investment from and for that paying consumer.

This causes late-coming consumers who pay profit to slowly gain property ownership in the land and tools needed to create future instances of that kind of product, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.

                ...

Paying workers with the property they need as consumers means they do not pay debt or rent for housing and do not pay profit for the goods and services they need.

Owning property For Product creates an imperfect assurance of future production. This replaces the fragile, for profit, token-based insurance industry.

When you accept product as ROI, you do not buy; it is yours already. This eliminates the final sale in a natural way ‚Äî similar to how you do not buy nuts from yourself when you own the tree, even if someone else does the work.

This also changes the focus of the company from exchange-value to use-value. Those who own For Product gain no benefit when market scarcity increases profit on that product. It realigns production with abundance and makes robots our friends.

==Terms of Operation
. Investors are consumers paying early for things they will need in the future.
. Investors become real co-owners and accept the product itself as the natural return.
. Workers are also investors who become vested owners as they complete work promises.
. Consumers who buy surplus product become owners when they pay more than costs.

===Property is the Investor‚Äôs right
Whether you pay with Property (but more likely the coin of the realm), Promises (commitments of future labor) or Profit (if you pay more than cost when buying surplus) you receive real Property co-ownership under these terms. Your shared control over those assets is weighted by the amount you own.

Investing Property usually means you are prepaying with plain-old-money which is then used to buy the Property on the open market without interest-bearing debt.

Investing Promises means workers commit to achieve future goals and gain access to property which vests as those promises are fulfilled.

Investing Profit means you bought surplus product, from other owners, for more than the costs of production, and gain access to unvested property ownership in as that profit is invested for you.

===Product is every Owner‚Äôs Return
Given: If you own a plant, you own the fruit and do not buy.
Given: If you own a plant with others, each owns their part.
Claim: We can use property ownership to preallocate product.

Investors become real owners in the property used for production and receive the product as a natural side-effect of that ownership.

Similar to crowdfunding, investors are consumers who prepay for future product, but here investors are real property owners that own the product automatically and so do not buy.

===Promise is a Worker‚Äôs Investment
Workers receive immediate access to property which vests on a ‚Äúwork-to-own‚Äù basis as they achieve the production expected by other investors.

Workers and other investor may choose to live on-site in temporary structures as the
structure. Agriculture should be integrated in the community in a careful way to achieve the same beauty as ornamental species while also creating the food security we must have.

Skills and capability must be proven, in some cases on a daily basis (to operate dangerous machinery, for example).

Cooking supplies
sanitation 
first aid supplies and references to enable low-cost, on-site basic healthcare.

Trading promises early in time allows us to specialize without passing tokens by solving the ‚Äúsimultaneous coincidence of wants‚Äù problem that faces typical barter. This arrangement also reverses the usual drive to perpetuate work and promotes permanent solutions.

Workers guilds could help buffer availability.

Subgroups may arbitrarily exclude any worker or guild.


===Profit is the Payer‚Äôs Investment
Surplus may be sold at any price, but some part of that profit must become property for the consumer who paid it.

The GNU GPL requires users gain access to the immaterial Sources of every object they use.

For Product requires consumers gain access to the material Sources of every product they use.

This is does done by ‚Äòreflecting‚Äô part of profit back to the consumer who paid it as their investment in either buying surplus property or new property. So when you buy some surplus product, you automatically receive property ownership in the land and tools required to create more of that good or service in the future.

Under these terms, consumers who pay profit gain small amounts of ownership in the land, water, plants, animals, tools, etc. required to create future copies of that product.

This causes the physical sources of production to be incrementally and continuously redistributed to those who pay for that growth. As those consumers gain property ownership in farms and factories, they regain control of production and pay only real costs.

The more Profit is treated as Payer Investment, the more quickly the system will stabilize.

===Subgroups may split the property
Under constraint of realistic divisibility, subgroups must be allowed to split from the majority while retaining property rights ‚Äî allowing cells to divide and wield their own localized governance.
