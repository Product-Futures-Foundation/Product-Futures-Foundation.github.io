Remixing ancient knowledge to fund, own and govern shared property in a GNU way.

Product Tickets🎫 represent future products and can be bought with traditional money.
Work Agreements📃 are voluntary labor contracts which can buy Source Title▦ ownership.
Source Titles▦ represent the land and tools required to produce those future products.

"'
    When you own 🐝s For Product,
    you own 🍯 before it is made.
'"

==                Terms of Operation
Consumers buy Product Tickets🎫 to fund that production without debt.
Workers become Source Title▦ owners as they complete Work Agreements📃.
The owner of Sources is the automatic owner of those future products.


==                Timeline
Issue Product Tickets🎫 and trade for money to buy Sources without debt.
Issue Source Titles▦ and trade for the Work required for that production.
Vest Source Titles▦ to those who complete Work Agreements📃.


==                Owning Sources For Product
Instead of buying product from the group, each Source Owner claims their part directly.
Profit is UNDEFINED because the final transaction of purchase simply does not occur.
Even if someone else (or a 🤖) does the work, ownership of the product does not change.

.    When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
.    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
.    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
.    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.


==                Worker Benefits
Everyone receives a "Basic Outcome" to insure health and safety.
1. A place to wash your body and clothes.
2. Healthy, natural, clean food and water.
3. A private and clean place to sleep.
4. Instructions to become and stay healthy.

Workers also gain real property ownership in the Sources of the products they use,
so do not pay rent or debt for housing and get all goods and services "at cost".


==                Profit Sharing
Each Source Owner may declare Product as Surplus to sell or allow to be sold to others at market price.

Just as the GNU GPL requires every user gain access to the Sources of every product they use, Source Titles▦ requires some profit gained in this way be used to increase Source Ownership for that user.


                ...


When we sell future products to own property and trade work in this way,
we create an imperfect insurance of that future production.
When you accept product as ROI, you do not buy; it is yours already.
Use value is refocused as the investor interest in 
Realigns production with abundance to safen automation.
