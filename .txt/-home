== Business Plan for Open Source Production of Physical Goods and Services

* Consumers buy Future Products to control the production of those goods and services.
* This funds the purchase of Sources (land, tools, water rights, etc.) without debt.

* Some consumers buy Future Products with money, just like crowdfunding.
* Others buy with Future Work when they sign one or more work contracts.

* Workers gain Source Ownership on a work-to-own basis as they complete work contracts.
* This enables debt-free housing, food sovereignty, water security and social stability.

* The owner of Sources is the owner of those products without purchase.
* This delivers goods and services at the real costs of that production.

* Property is held to protect against being charged price above cost.
* The return on investment is that you *avoid* paying profit or rent.

* Abundance and permanent solutions return as natural goals. Economy and ecology align.
* Production is vertically integrated through permaculture and localized manufacturing.

In this model, the owner of Sources is the automatic owner of those future products.
Instead of buying products from the group, each Source Owner claims their part directly.
Profit is UNDEFINED because the final transaction of purchase simply does not occur.
Even if someone else (or ðŸ¤–) does the work, ownership of the product does not change.

.    When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
.    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
.    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
.    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

Workers gain property ownership in the Sources of the products they use,
and so receive all goods and services 'at cost' and under their control.

When we sell future products to own sources and trade work this way,
we create an imperfect insurance of that future production.

As the investor's interest is refocused on the product,
abundance returns as the true purpose of production
while automation and ðŸ¤– are no longer a threat.
