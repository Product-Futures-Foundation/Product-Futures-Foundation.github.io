Remixing ancient knowledge to buy, own and govern shared property in a GNU way.

Issue Product Tickets🎫 and trade for money to buy Sources without debt.
Issue Source Titles▦ and trade for the Work required for that production.
Vest Source Titles▦ to those who complete Work Agreements📃.


==                Terms
Consumers buy Product Tickets🎫 to fund that production without debt.
Workers become Source Title▦ owners as they complete Work Agreements📃.
The owner of Sources is the automatic owner of those future products.


==                Owning Sources For Product
Instead of buying product from the group, each Source Owner claims their part directly.
Profit is UNDEFINED because the final transaction of purchase simply does not occur.
Even if someone else (or a 🤖) does the work, ownership of the product does not change.

.    When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
.    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
.    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
.    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.


==                Benefits
A "Basic Outcome" insures health and safety.
1. A place to wash your body and clothes.
2. Healthy, natural, clean food and water.
3. A private and clean place to sleep.
4. Instructions to become and stay healthy.

Workers gain property ownership in the Sources of the products they use,
and so receive all goods and services "at cost" and under their control.


==                 Results
When we sell future products to own source and trade work this way,
we create an imperfect insurance of that future production.

As the investor's interest is refocused on the product,
abundance returns as the true purpose of production
while automation and 🤖 are no longer a threat.
