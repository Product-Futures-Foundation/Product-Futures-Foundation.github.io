. Consumers buy Future Products to fund that production without debt.
. Workers become Source Owners as they complete Work Agreements📃.
. Source Owners are automatically owners of those Future Products.
. Consumers become Source Owners if they pay profit when buying surplus.


==                Owning Sources For Product
Instead of buying product from the group, each Source Owner claims their part directly.
Profit is UNDEFINED because the final transaction of purchase simply does not occur.
Even if someone else (or a 🤖) does the work, ownership of the product does not change.

.    When the consumers are owners there is no sale.
.    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
.    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
.    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.


==                Worker Benefits
Everyone receives a "Basic Outcome" to insure health and safety.
1. A place to wash your body and clothes.
2. Healthy, natural, clean food and water.
3. A private and clean place to sleep.
4. Instructions to become and stay healthy.

Workers also gain real property ownership in the Sources of the products they use,
so do not pay rent or debt for housing and get all goods and services "at cost".


==                Profit Sharing
Any co-owner may decide any amount of the product they own is more than they want, and so declare it as surplus product to be sold to other consumers with insufficient ownership.
The price of surplus is set by the market, but some amount of profit gained in this way must be treated as an investment from and for that paying consumer.
This causes late-coming consumers who pay profit to slowly gain property ownership in the land and tools needed to create future instances of that kind of product, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.


                ...


Owning property For Product creates an imperfect assurance of future production.
When you accept product as ROI, you do not buy; it is yours already.
This also changes the focus of the company from exchange-value to use-value.
It realigns production with abundance and makes robots our friends.
