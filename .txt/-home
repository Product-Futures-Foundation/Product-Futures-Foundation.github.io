= Open Source Production in the material world through the For Product model.

== Plan
Find land for sale that can be used to build a permacultured private city.
Verify the essential goods and services we can produce at that location.

== Fund
Issue Product Tickets🎫 representing those future goods and services.
Auction Product Tickets🎫 to secure the land and tools without debt.

== Work
Issue Source Titles▦ representing small amounts of land ownership.
Issue Work Agreements📃 representing commitments to achieve that production.
Auction Source Titles▦ to secure Work Agreement📃 signatures.

== Own
If both auctions succeed, buy land and tools and announce first day of work.
Vest Source Titles▦ to workers as the first round-of-production is completed.
Workers own the Source Titles▦ used to fulfill Product Tickets🎫 they bought.
