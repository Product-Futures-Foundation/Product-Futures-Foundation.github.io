=    User Freedom in the Material World



Earth Change is a new way for groups to own and control the production they need.
The For Product model uses property ownership to minimize rent, interest and profit.

Like the GNU GPL, users gain the sources of production in 3 ways:
. When they buy future products.
. When they commit to work in the future.
. When they pay profit while buying surplus.
