2020-05-08: Production 
Issue "Product Tickets🎫" representing future goods and services.
Sell those tokens to buy the land and tools required for that production |without debt|.
Issue "Work Contracts📑" to secure the labor required for that production.
Vest the land and tools to those who complete that production.
Apportion the vesting in size according to value added,
  and in kind by the goods and services that user chose.

Buy the property required for that production 
In this way we can buy land and tools without debt
to build permacultured cities under the direct control
of those citizen-owners to enable them to supply themselves
with all critical goods and services such as food and housing.

### Goals
Once we own land without debt,
the stage will be set
to achieve Self Reliance in the material world,
and because of that, also in the immaterial.

### Mechanics
The Bonding Curve of each NFT follow the _projected_ value of
that particular good or service being offered,
based on the property and work used in that production.

For example, you can invest in 🌳,
but may not have 🥑 for 15 years!

Voting☐☑☒ could be expressed by directly funding future production through any number of semi-continuous crowdfunding/crowdsourcing campaigns.

I would like to sincerely propose we gamify:
1. Coins representing a projected quantity and quality of **future** goods and services.
2. Real property ownership in land▦ and water-rights🌊 and other Means of Production🛠.
3. Legally binding work contracts📑 to achieve that **future** production.

### Timeline
**Mint** and sell NFTs representing future goods and services.
Buy the property required for that production **without debt**.
**Vest** that property to the workers who complete that production.

### Purpose
In this way we can buy land and tools without debt to
build permacultured cities under the direct control of those citizen-owners
for the sole purpose of supplying the goods and services
such as food and housing that they know they must have.

### Goals
Once we own land without debt,
the stage will be set to achieve Self Reliance
in the material world, and because of that, also in the immaterial.

### Mechanics
The Bonding Curve of each NFT follow the _projected_ value of
that particular good or service being offered,
based on the property and work used in that production.
