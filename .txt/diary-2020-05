2020-05-21: The Purpose of Production and the Quest for Value

Why do we organize in groups?

What values do we seek?

Is it the real goods and services we actually need?

Why is it so hard to achieve such basic goals?

Can we own land FOR PRODUCT
to regain control of production?

And trade skillz to make it happen?

To provide ourselves with food and shelter
through vertically integrated permaculture.

I would like to sincerely propose we gamify:
1. Coins representing a projected quantity and quality of **future** goods and services.
2. Real property ownership in land▦ and water-rights🌊 and other Means of Production🛠.
3. Legally binding work contracts📑 to achieve that **future** production.

### Timeline
**Mint** and sell NFTs representing future goods and services.
Buy the property required for that production **without debt**.
**Vest** that property to the workers who complete that production.

### Purpose
In this way we can buy land and tools without debt to
build permacultured cities under the direct control of those citizen-owners
for the sole purpose of supplying the goods and services
such as food and housing that they know they must have.

### Goals
Once we own land without debt,
the stage will be set to achieve Self Reliance
in the material world, and because of that, also in the immaterial.

### Mechanics
The Bonding Curve of each NFT follow the _projected_ value of
that particular good or service being offered,
based on the property and work used in that production.

For example, you can invest in 🌳,
but may not have 🥑 for 15 years!

Voting☐☑☒ could be expressed by directly funding future production through any number of semi-continuous crowdfunding/crowdsourcing campaigns.
