debt
buy sources, begin production

try to sell product to consumers for more than cost
try to payback debt plus interest

GNU way:
no debt
try to pre-sell product to consumers
buy sources, begin production
  workers gain source ownership, so receive food, housing, and most other crucial products at the real costs of production.
no debt or interest to repay

#CityDAO uses a subscription funding model to achieve "Public Works".
Instead of collecting taxes and voting, citizens fund what they want.

2019-07-14: DAOTalk.org/t/the-semi-sovereign-dao-a-state-within-an-estate
This DAO attempts to orchestrate the acquisition and management of the Land, Tools and Work required to create and operate a series of permaculture-based private cities.

Potential members buy *subscriptions* of future products by paying with traditional money or with a commitment to work in the future.

These subscriptions are meant to achieve all "Public Works" within the city, including many goods and services not usually supplied by a government such as food and housing.

Instead of taxes and votes, each citizen just funds the production they want and ignores the rest.

The DAO checks local prices for the Land, Tools and Work required to establish that production then issues and auctions Non-Fungible Tokens representing For Product ownership in the Land and Tools (such as land, water-rights, hives, tools, bees, etc.).

Each token also represent that future product at a **projected** quality and rate (such as "One Pint of AA honey each month").

Some tokens are sold for "traditional money" to purchase the Land and Tools.

The rest are sold to Workers who commit to achieve that future production.

Dependence on outside funds is decreased as vertical-integration and circular production systems are established.

Richard Stallman codified part of his answer to this through the GNU GPL trade agreement which allows you to "make money" when selling the *outputs* of production (the product), but requires those consumers gain access to the *inputs* of production (the sources), even when they do not know how to use the sources.

Generalized to the material realm, this strange arrangement would cause consumers to gain ownership in their homes and the farms and factories required to produce all they use.

This means workers would be paid as usual, but 'rentiers' would be inhibited from draining value from the system.

We, the consumers, will soon realize we can buy private property in groups, without debt, to create private cities fully owned and controlled by us to finally supply ourselves with the boring Basic Outcome we need without paying tribute to others.
This will require a rethinking of *who* should own the farms and factories.
Hint: The goal of the GNU GPL is to insure consumer freedom by requiring each consumer gain at-cost access to the Sources of that production.
Once we see that property ownership in Sources (such as an Avocado tree and the land under it) can be used to "pre-allocate" goods and services to those who need them *without sale*, we will also realize this is the only real answer to the 'problem' of automation.
It is the *consumers*, not the *workers* who must own and control the Means of Production to escape the automation apocalypse and finally regain control of the products we use.
Until then we will grovel and beg before the absentee landlords as they stand between us and solutions to perpetuate the profit we have been fooled into believing is the purpose of production...

This DAO is designed to auto-acquisition the Land, Capital and Labor required to create and operate a series of permaculture-based private cities.

The DAO offers a simple web interface for potential members buy *future* products using money or work.

For each product, the DAO calculates all the land, tools, plants, animals and work required for that production, check prices to buy those sources, then issues and auctions FootCoin - each as a Non-Fungible Token representing real property ownership over 1 square foot of land under terms of the For Product model.

The DAO sells half of the FootCoins for "regular old money" to be used to fund the purchase of the Land and Capital.

The DAO sells the other half to workers who commit to achieve future work.

For any coin or money:
How fast should it be issued (mined)?
How should [in|de]flation be related to productivity?

A coin backed by property held #ForProduct
would only be issued when buying more property,
so the supply should kinda track future production.

"'In a metal-based monetary system, there is a natural feedback that helps keep the mining industry from producing too much or too little new money.  If the industry produces too much new money, the ensuing inflation of prices and wages will make mining less profitable in real terms, and discourage further investments in mining.  If the mining industry does not produce enough new money, the deflation of prices and wages will make mining more profitable in real terms, and encourage further investments in mining.'"

This is a very good point I had not considered.

But, while the production of gold is 'anchored' by the costs of mining,
the amount of gold in a society is a poor estimation of the *effectiveness* of the economy at delivering crucial the goods and services it purports to achieve.

Hey all,
I have been thinking about how to create a DAO that would help groups of people organize to own and control land and water-rights and tools and other things required to create the goods and services they need.
The rough idea is to create a simple web form where customers can buy 'future' products (meaning they pay before the product is created) as a sort of built-in crowdfunding mechanism.
So customers would buy future milk, honey, apples, etc.
And the DAO would (with human help initially) determine the amount of land,  cattle and bees and trees that are needed to achieve that production,
Then it would scour real-estate listings to determine the price of all the inputs to set the minimum bid for each Token - where each Token is really more of a Title in that it represents real productive ownership under terms of the For Product business model.
The DAO must also acquisition the work needed for that production,
so I was thinking one way to do that would be to pay workers with these special Title-Tokens.
Consider an overly simplistic example I sometimes call
 SquareFootCoin - where each coin is "backed by" (represents real property ownership of) 1 square foot of land.
The square might be part of an Avocado orchard (meaning you own that % of those future Avocados), or maybe part of a housing complex (meaning you own and can live in an apartment there if you own enough of these Titles).
You can read more about the idea at http://product-futures-foundation.github.io/earth%20change.htm
