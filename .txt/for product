"For Product" is an investment model that uses property rights to preallocate
reduces token passing
selling of the product.

Profit does not exist because there is no sale.

When you own productive Sources in the For Product manner, you own Future Products


Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.

You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

There is no sale when the owners are the eaters.
And profit does not exist when there is no sale.

The price each pays as a consumer is the costs
that same person paid as owner and the product
itself becomes the natural return on investment.

Paying others for work is a cost of production.
But every worker is a consumer needing Property.

So Promises become Property as work is finished.
This protects workers from paying consumer rent.
