=                The For Product Business Model

== Statement of Intent
Own land and trade work to produce essential goods and services without debt.

== Terms of Operation
Product Tickets represent a claim of ownership over future goods and services.
Source Titles represent property ownership in land, tools, water-rights, mineral-rights.
Work Agreements represent legally binding commitments to achieve future production.

== Startup Timeline
Find raw land for sale outside of city limits to build self-hosted micro-cities.
Verify essential goods and services we to be produced.
Within the limits of production of each location

Issue Product Tickets representing those future goods and services.
Auction Product Tickets to secure the land and tools without debt.

Issue Source Titles representing small amounts of land ownership.
Issue Work Agreements representing commitments to achieve production.
Auction Source Titles to secure the Work Agreement signatures.

If both auctions succeed, we buy the land and resources to begin.

Source Titles vest to workers as production is completed.

Source Titles can be used as collateral for more risky projects.

== "'Buy Product Ticket'" [This is like rewards-based crowdfunding.]
  Pay with future work or money to receive a time-delayed good or service.
  Workers implicitly trade with other workers in this way. (work-for-work)
== "'Bid-to-sign Work Agreement'" [Pay with future work.]
  Test to qualify or use the apprenticeship program. (work-to-learn)
  Receive a Basic Outcome of essential goods and services. (sign-to-use)
  Workers gain Source Titles as Work Agreements are completed. (work-to-own)
  Owners of Source Titles receive future products without purchase. (own-to-use)
== "'Define New Product Ticket'" [Create a crowdfun (sic) campaign.]
  List work and sources required to begin production.
  List delivery schedules and production constraints.
  List pollution and any unavoidable externalities.
  Change (your version of) a proposal to vote on implementation details.
== "'Issue Source Titles'" [Land acquisition and allocation.]
  Show map of land for sale, with default being nearest that user.
  Zoom in to see water rights and zoning restrictions.
  Show Product Ticket proposals and funding status.
  Change (your version of) a map to vote on the layout.
== User Interface (UI)
SCREEN[Pay-to-Play]
  Pay with money to own Product Tickets (crowdfund).

SCREEN[work-to-own]
  Sign Work Agreements to own future goods and services.

SCREEN[Define Product Ticket]
  For each Product,
    Define SERVING-SIZE and a MIN-SCALE.
    Estimate production constraints like temperature, water, elevation.
    Estimate time delay before each round-of-production.
    Estimate pollution and other externalities.
    For each SERVING-SIZE at MIN-SCALE,
      Estimate the quality and quantity of that future production.
      Estimate Work, Sources, and startup products.

== Remixing
Crowd Funding: Commit money or work to prepay for goods or services.
Time Banking: Gain land ownership as you complete work Agreements.
Mutual Credit: That land is collateral for more risky contracts.
Home Economics: Owners receive the product itself as the natural ROI.
Free Software: Hold land to insure user freedom in the material realm.
