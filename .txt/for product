The For Product model changes how and why we work and own
to resolve the conflict between abundance and finance.

Product Ticket🎫 represents some future good or service.
Source Title▦ represents fractional ownership in land or a fixed asset.
Work Agreement📃 represents contract obligation for a future service.

Users may:
. Buy Product Tickets🎫 representing future products.
. Sign Work Agreements📃 for Source Titles▦ which vest as work is complete.
. Buy Product Tickets🎫 representing surplus products.

The system must:
Sell  Product Tickets🎫 to buy the sources to get production started.
Grant limited source access to those who sign Work Agreements📃.  Issue expiring 🔑 here.
Vest source ownership to those who complete Work Agreements📃.  Issue Source Titles▦ here.
Sell surplus Product Tickets🎫 to buy more sources and onboard more workers.
Use Source Titles▦ and Work Agreements📃 to pre-allocate goods and services.

== COMMENTARY
We can make businesses owned by the
consumers who need those products
to regain control of production
and make price equal cost.

For example, if you own an avocado tree,
you own those avocados without purchase,
even if someone else or 🤖 does the work.

This is a generalization of Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent

By combining the roles of consumer and owner,
purchase disappears, and those profits with it.

When consumer is owner, there is no sale and no profit.
Of course every worker is also a consumer.
