/// COMMENTARY
// When we buy products
// in the usual For Profit model,
// we pay all the costs of production,
// and also profit as ownership changes
// for each step in the supply chain.

// We can make businesses owned by the
// consumers who need those products
// so price and cost are the same.

// For example, if you own an avocado tree,
// you own those avocados without purchase,
// even if someone else or 🤖 does the work.

// This is a generalization of
// Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent

// By combining the roles
// of consumer and owner,
// purchase disappears,
// and those profits with it.

// There is no profit
// since the consumer
// remains the owner.

// BTW: Every worker is a consumer.

// From the perspective of a group, we can:
// 1. Sell future products to buy property {land, tools, etc.} without debt.  This is just crowdfunding to supply workers with the property required for production.
// 2. Buy future work in exchange for property.  Workers, and only workers, gain property ownership, without debt, as they complete work agreements.
// 3. Use property ownership and work agreements to "pre-allocate" goods and services.  This creates a true insurance system.
// 4. Sell surplus products to buy even more property without debt.  This is a profit-sharing strategy to supply workers with more property.
