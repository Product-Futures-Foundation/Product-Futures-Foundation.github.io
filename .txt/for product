=Overview
Using property ownership to minimize rent, interest and profit.
Workers and consumers become owners to ensure future production.
They buy and own productive inputs because they need the outputs.

=Timeline
Future products are sold to buy sources required to begin production.
These sources are 'sold' to workers who commit to future production.
Owners accept the product itself as the natural return on investment.
Owners sell surplus product but some profit becomes payer investment.

=Terms
1. Consumers become source owners when they buy future product.
2. Workers become source owners as they fulfill work promises.
3. The owners of sources own that same % of the future product.
4. Consumers become source owners when they buy surplus product.
