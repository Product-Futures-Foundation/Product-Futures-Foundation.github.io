The For Product model is defined below using the LENS contract language.

=Terms
. Money becomes Sources: Consumers gain sources when they buy future products.
. Promises become Sources: Workers gain sources as they fulfill work promises.
. Sources become Product: Owners of sources are also owners of future products.
. Profit becomes Sources: Consumers gain sources when they buy surplus products.

=== Money becomes Sources
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for future products with traditional money, but instead of just receiving one round of production, they become the real property owners of the land and tools that will be purchased for that production.

These investors take risk to *avoid* paying the profit they would otherwise pay when buying that product on the open market.


=== Promises become Sources
Every worker is a consumer who needs source ownership for the same reasons.

Workers gain immediate access to sources which vest as work is complete.
Vested sources become collateral to access even more valuable sources.


=== Sources become Product
Source owners accept the product itself as the direct and natural return on investment, and so do not sell or buy the finished product (except surplus as explained below).

>>        Just as the owner of a tree owns all of that fruit,
>>    each co-owner of an orchard owns his portion of that fruit.

The price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as an source owner while the final sale is eliminated, leaving profit undefined.

Instead of selling the product to another consumer, the product has been pre-distributed to the consumer who predicted they would need it.  There is no sale because it is already the individuated property of that consumer+owner.

This allows these groups to operate at zero profit even while all shareholders remain satisfied.  The numeric return is approximately the same as a For Profit investment but inverted in that the shareholder *avoids* paying profit for that product.

This is a generalization of economic imputation.


=== Profit becomes Sources
Any owner may sell surplus product and even collect profit, but some of that profit must be invested for that very same paying user to buy newly issued Source Titles, or to buy Source Titles being offered for sale by other owners.

This causes all users to incrementally gain the property ownership in the sources required to finally also control the production they need and receive those products at cost.
