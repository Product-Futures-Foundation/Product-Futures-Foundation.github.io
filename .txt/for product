The Earth Change DAO issues ECT tokens under the For Product model.

The For Product model helps people to control the INPUTS of production so they control the OUTPUTS.

Consumers invest to become owners and then accept the product itself as the natural return on investment and thereby avoid paying the profit they would have otherwise paid when buying that product from someone else.

Instead of selling and buying the product, each portion is directly claimed by each property owner.

There is no sale, so there is no profit.

    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

This sounds great for consumers, but what about the poor workers?

Well, every worker is also a consumer who also needs products.

So workers gain property as they complete work and remain debt free.
