   You do not buy, when you own it already!

      When you own property For Product,
         you own the future Products
         BECAUSE you own the Sources

Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.

You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

There is no sale when the owners are the eaters.
And profit does not exist when there is no sale.

The price each pays as a consumer is the costs
that same person paid as owner and the product
itself becomes the natural return on investment.

Paying others for work is a cost of production.
But every worker is a consumer needing Property.

So Promises become Property as work is finished.
This protects workers from paying consumer rent.

This strange arrangement preallocates products

to those people who know they will need them
eliminates the sale in the traditional sense.

Profit does not exist when there is no sale.

Commit to work in the future to receive immediate access to property that vests incrementally as those promises are completed.

Each owner may retain all product and never declare surplus.

If surplus products are sold, a % of that profit must be treated as the payer's investment.

causing those payers to slowly gain property in the land and tools needed to create future instances of that kind of product, and so eventually also avoid paying profit.
