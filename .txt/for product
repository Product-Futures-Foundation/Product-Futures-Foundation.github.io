The For Product investment model uses property rights to preallocate products.

Consumers invest to become owners and thereby avoid paying profit in the market.

Instead of selling the product, each portion is claimed by each property owner.

    Just as when you own a tree, you own the fruit,
    when you co-own a forest, you co-own the fruit.
    You own the outputs because you own the inputs.

This sounds great for consumers, but what about the poor workers?

Ah, but every worker *is* a consumer.  We must protect their need to consume.

Property vests as Promises are completed to protect workers from debt.
