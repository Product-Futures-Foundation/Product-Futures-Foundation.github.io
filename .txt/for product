#                The For Product Business Model

## Statement of Intent
* Empower groups-of-groups to own and control the production of essential goods and services.

## Definitions
* Product Tickets represent future goods and services.
* Work Agreements represent legally binding commitments to achieve future production.
* Source Titles represent property ownership in land, tools, and other productive assets.

## Terms of Operation
* You may buy Product Tickets with money to receive that future good or service, just like crowdfunding.
* You may buy Product Tickets by signing Work Agreements to achieve some future production in the system.
* When paying with Work Agreements, you also receive Source Title ownership as that production is completed.
* As a Source Title owner, you may decide what must and must not be produced on that land.
* As a Source Title owner, you must supply the work required for that production, or sign Work Agreements to fill other requests in the system.  You must have a chain-of-exchange to those other requests.
* As a Source Title owner, you are the *automatic* owner of all future production on that land.
* These terms must work when co-owing in groups and groups-of-groups, in a fractal way.

## Pilot Project Startup Timeline
* Find raw land for sale outside of city limits to build a self-hosted micro-city.
* Verify which essential goods and services can be produced at this location.
* Issue and auction Product Tickets to secure land and tools startup supplies without debt.
* Issue and auction Source Titles to secure Work Agreement signatures.
* If both auctions succeed, the property is purchased and production begins!

## User Interface

### "'Buy Product Ticket'"
  * Pay with future work or money to receive a time-delayed good or service.
  * Workers implicitly trade with other workers in this way. (work-for-work)

### "'Bid-to-sign Work Agreement'" [This is how you pay with future work.]
  * Qualify by passing tests.  All jobs have apprentice onboarding. (work-to-learn)
  * Receive immediate access to essential goods and services. (sign-to-use)
  * Workers gain Source Titles as Work Agreements are completed. (work-to-own)
  * Trade Work Agreements for signatures of others. (work-for-work)

### "'Issue Source Titles'"
  * Show map of land for sale, with default being nearest that user.
  * Zoom in to see water rights and zoning restrictions.
  * Show Product Ticket proposals and funding status.
  * Change (your version of) a map to vote on the layout.
  * Owners of Source Titles receive future products without purchase. (own-to-use)
  * For each ZONE,
    * Show pending Product Ticket proposals and funding status.
    * Show water-rights, mineral-rights, external restrictions.

### "'Define New Product Ticket'" [Recipe for that production.]
  * List work and sources required to create that product.
  * List delivery schedules and production constraints.
  * List pollution and any unavoidable externalities.
  * Change (your version of) any Product Ticket to vote on future production.
  * For each Product,
    * Define SERVING-SIZE and MIN-SCALE.
    * Estimate production constraints like temperature, water, elevation.
    * Estimate time delay to complete each round-of-production (first will usually be longest).
    * Estimate pollution and other externalities.
    * For each SERVING-SIZE at MIN-SCALE,
      * Estimate projected quality and quantity
      * Estimate land, work tools and startup supplies to begin.
