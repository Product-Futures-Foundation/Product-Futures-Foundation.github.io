Each Source Title (ST) is a deed of property ownership over a finite physical source and implicit ownership all future products created by that source.

Each ST is issued as fully unique (non-fungible), but contract options could treat some assets as semi-fungible

The Earth Change DAO issues and sells STs to buy the sources that back those tokens.
