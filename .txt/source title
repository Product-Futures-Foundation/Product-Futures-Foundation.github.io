Source Titlesâ–¦ represent the INPUTS of production such as land and tools,
while Product TicketsðŸŽ« represent the potential OUTPUTS of production such as apples and taxi rides.

Each Source Titleâ–¦ represents real property ownership in productive assets such as land, tools, water-rights; living things like plants, animals; and ownership of all future Products created by those Sources.

Both Sources and Products are held under terms of the For Product contract.

Source Titlesâ–¦ are issued and auctioned to secure the sources and skills required for that production.

When you own a Source Titleâ–¦, you also own all Future Products.
