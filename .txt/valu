=== Value Forms

Sources such as land, water, plants, animals are fundamental.

Use value is the usefulness of a product the end user.

Exchange value is the difference between the price a user pays *now* and the costs an owner paid *in the past*.

    profit = user_price - owner_costs

Ahh, so when user is owner, profit is
UNDEFINED because there is no sale!

Future Value is the future productive potential of Sources plus Labor.

Labor Value is the productive potential of human effort (work + metawork (automation, permaculture)) applied to Sources.
