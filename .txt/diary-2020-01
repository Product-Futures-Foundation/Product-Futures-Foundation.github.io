2020-01-18: Phone app idea for "chat bots" that continuously listen to the conversation in the room and talk as though they were there without prompting.  Like Alexa or Siri, but instead of needing to ask them directly, they offer advice at their own discretion.

Various personalities such as Mr. Know it all, Drunk Bastard, Silly Simon, Lying Larry, Grumpy Grampa, Nosey Grandma, ... each trying to be helpful in their own way.

I really want the Nosey Grandma to help me when driving since the Maps app is terrible at letting me know what is coming up.  I want her to be like "You better get over, the offramp is in half a mile!".

We have been taught the workers must be the owners, but maybe that teaching is incorrect.

Instead of the baker owning the bakery, the miller owning the mill, and the farmer owning the farm,
imagine the people who actually need the bread own the bakery, mill and farm.

When the consumers of a product:

Own the Means of that Production and
Accept the product itself as the return on that investment,
there is no need to sell the product, for it is already owned by those who will consume it!

This special arrangements eliminates the usual need to buy/sell that product and so eliminates profit in a natural way leaving those special shareholders happy that they were able to avoid paying profit they would have otherwise paid if they had bought that product from the market.

This also prepares us for robots that will soon be able to plant and harvest :ear_of_rice:, transport, grind, mix and bake the :bread: with almost no human intervention.

Consumers can own farms and factories and wells and refineries for the insane reason that we simply need the results, instead of owning for the tired game of attempting to overcharge each other.

We, as consumers, already pay all the costs of production (and even more when we pay profit), so it is easy to see we can afford to be the owners once we realize the dream of worker ownership was an accidental or purposeful misdirection on our road to Free as in Freedom physical production!
