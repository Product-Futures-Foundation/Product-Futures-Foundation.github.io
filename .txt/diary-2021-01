We can use fractional land ownership to secure future goods and trade work contracts to secure future services and thereby create a sort of "assurance network" which incentivizes preventive maintenance and long-term solutions.

Those who invest money will receive future products, just like crowdfunding.  These investors do not receive land ownership.

That money is used to buy land and tools and startup supplies to begin without debt.

Those who invest work will receive future products AND land ownership as that work is completed.

For example, a group of consumers might own a field of grain, each attempting to own just enough of the field required to produce just enough of the grain-based products they think they will use in the future.

Each job is auctioned at an ever increasing value-ratio as each crowdfunding campaign nears completion.

Unpleasant jobs will have a higher value-ratio since fewer people will want to do them.

Highly skilled jobs will also have a higher value-ratio because fewer people will qualify to do them

The value-ratio is the socially-defined difference between one job and another as determined by the auction.
