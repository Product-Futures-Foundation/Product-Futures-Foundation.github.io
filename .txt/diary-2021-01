Saint IGNUcius was set to face a beast standing before the Door of Many Solutions.
But on the way, he deftly realized Copyright can host any arbitrary license.
The Copyright holders (or 'owners') determine the rules of engagement.
And so he penned his own to reflect control from owners to users.
The GNU GPL enable owners to voluntarily cede excess power.
Users gain access to the virtual Sources of production.
Users hold Sources to control those Future Products.


2021-01-10: Standard consumers-to-workers value flow.

If we can write a Terms of Operation to address problems we know might happen otherwise, then apply those terms to real property that 'we' (any group) actually own to make a "puddle of freedom" in the physical realm.
We can buy undeveloped land without debt by selling products we intend to make - even before we have actually created them, just like crowdfunding.

This will require large scale ecosystem restoration using Permaculture techniques￼ to build the food forests that will supply all the raw materials to create a (series of) self-hosted and productively-sovereign private cities under the direct control of those citizen-owners.

There is plenty of raw land within 100 miles of the bay area for sale at far less than $1/square_foot.￼

Trading future work creates an "assurance network" which incentivizes preventive maintenance and long-term solutions.

Each job is auctioned at an ever increasing value-ratio as each crowdfun (sic) campaign nears completion.

Unpleasant jobs will have higher value-ratios because fewer will want to do them.
Highly skilled jobs will have higher value-ratios because fewer will qualify.

Metarules for making rules without rulers:
Define rules before funding.

Hi @Michael Shea , I appreciate your question, and would like to highlight how the 'rules' might help "hedge against an aristocracy".
1. The Trust vests land ownership to the workers as they complete work contracts.
2. Those who buy products early (crowdfunders) do not receive land ownership.
3. Every worker is a consumer.


2021-01-06: Future Productions
We partition land ownership to secure future goods
and trade work contracts to secure future services.

You may "invest money" to receive future products, just like rewards-based crowdfunding.  These investors do not receive land ownership.  That money is used to buy land and tools and startup supplies to begin without debt.

You may "invest work" to receive future products AND to gain ownership in the land used for the production of those specific products.  Every worker is a consumer.  You work to own land, but you hold that land to consume the results of future production.

The land must be temporarily owned by a Trust until ownership vests to those who complete work contracts.

The Trust must not change the Terms of Operation.

Each job has a 'value-ratio' set by auction.

When the campaign begins, all jobs have a value-ratio of 1.

The value-ratio increases as the campaign nears completion.

Unpleasant jobs have a higher value-ratio since fewer people will want to do them.

Highly skilled jobs will also have a higher value-ratio because fewer people will qualify to do them

The value-ratio is the socially-defined difference between one job and another as determined by the auction.
