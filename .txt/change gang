==Overview
This is a rough draft of one implementation of the For Product organizational form.

==Timeline
===Plan
Find raw land for sale that can be used to build a permacultured private city.
Verify which essential goods and services can be produced at that location.

===Fund
Issue Product TicketsðŸŽ« representing those future goods and services.
Auction Product TicketsðŸŽ« to secure the land and tools without debt.

===Work
Issue Source Titlesâ–¦ representing small amounts of land ownership.
Issue Work AgreementsðŸ“ƒ representing commitments to achieve that production.
Auction Source Titlesâ–¦ to secure Work AgreementðŸ“ƒ signatures.

===Own
If both auctions succeed, buy land and tools and announce the first day of work.
Vest Source Titlesâ–¦ to workers as the first round-of-production is completed.
Workers own the Source Titlesâ–¦ used to fulfill Product TicketsðŸŽ« they bought.

==User Interface
