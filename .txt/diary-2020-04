PREBOOT (1/4):

Mint Product Tickets🎫 representing the future production of goods and services.

Mint Work Agreements📃 representing the human INPUTS required for that Production.

Mint Source Titles▦ representing all other INPUTS required for that Production.

BOOT (2/4):
Sell Product Tickets🎫 for $ to buy the Sources (land and tools).

"Sell" Source Titles▦ in exchange for Work Agreement📃 signatures.

Once all Product Tickets🎫 are sold, buy the Sources and begin production!

SETUP (3/4):
Workers receive immediate access to Sources required to wash, eat and rest.

Source Titles▦ vest to the workers who deliver those goods and services.

Product Ticket🎫 hodlers are repaid with the first round of production.

RUN (4/4):
Source Titles▦ are held #ForProduct to ensure that future production.

Those who own Source Titles▦ own those #FutureProducts without sale.

Sharing Sources and trading Work enables productive sovereignty.

#GameB Timeline:

Issue and sell "Product Tickets🎫" to buy Sources without debt.
Issue "Source Titles▦" representing fractional Source ownership.
Vest Source Titles▦ to workers as they complete that production.
These special worker+owners hold Source Titles▦ "For Product".

"Sources" include all the land, tools, organisms and startup supplies we need to begin a pilot project.

The "For Product" model ensures the future production of goods and services using a set of legal agreements enforced by:
  Private Property: Source Titles▦ represent micro-ownership in land.
  Contract Law: Work Agreements📃 represent commitments of future labor.
  Subscriptions: Product Tickets🎫 represent Future Production.

The first round-of-production is delivered to "Product Ticket🎫" holders.
Afterward, Source Titles▦ owners are the owners of all future production.

The supply chain requires
Sources and Skills as usual, but are not sold at each step.

When you sell products before they are created, you receive funding without debt or equity.
#FutureProducts uses ancient #FinanceInnovation to avoid interest-bearing loans.

The #ForProduct model imperfectly insures #FutureProduction through:
1. Property ownership as Source Titles▦.
2. Contract law as Work Agreements📃.
3. Future Products as Product Tickets🎫.

Product Tickets🎫 are sold to buy Sources without debt.
Source Titles▦ are 'sold' for Work Agreement📃 signatures.
Sources vest to workers as Work Agreements📃 are completed.

Users may:
Buy Product Tickets🎫 representing future products. (crowd fund)
Sign Work Agreements📃 to gain Source Title▦ ownership. (work to own)
Sign Work Agreements📃 for other Work Agreement📃 signatures. (trade work)

2020-04-04:
We will sell #FutureProducts to fund without debt or equity.
We will buy raw land and build #PrivateCities to reclaim the reins.
We will hold that property #ForProduct to avoid profit and rent.
We will trade work early to avoid the usual problems of barter.
