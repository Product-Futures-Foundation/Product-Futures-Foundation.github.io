Possible Timeline to a Right Livelihood:

1 Issue Product Tickets🎫 representing future products.
2 Sell these Product Tickets🎫 to buy Sources (land, tools, startup supplies) without debt.
3 Issue Source Titles▦ representing the Sources required for that production.
4 'Sell' these Source Titles▦ for Work Agreements📃 required for that production.
5 Each worker receives access the Sources required for a "Basic Outcome" of products.
6 Product Ticket🎫 holders (funders) are rewarded as that production is completed.
7 Source Titles▦ vest (workers gain real property ownership in those Sources) as they fulfill Work Agreements📃.
8 Source Title▦ holders (Source Owners) own future products without purchase.
8a Those future products have been 'pre-allocated' to those Source owners without sale.

When you sell products before they are created, you receive funding without debt or equity.
#FutureProducts uses ancient #FinanceInnovation to avoid interest-bearing loans.

The #ForProduct model imperfectly insures #FutureProduction through:
1. Property ownership as Source Titles▦.
2. Contract law as Work Agreements📃.
3. Future Products as Product Tickets🎫.

Product Tickets🎫 are sold to buy Sources without debt.
Source Titles▦ are 'sold' for Work Agreement📃 signatures.
Sources vest to workers as Work Agreements📃 are completed.

Users may:
Buy Product Tickets🎫 representing future products. (crowd fund)
Sign Work Agreements📃 to gain Source Title▦ ownership. (work to own)
Sign Work Agreements📃 for other Work Agreement📃 signatures. (trade work)

2020-04-04:
We will sell #FutureProducts to fund without debt or equity.
We will buy raw land and build #PrivateCities to reclaim the reins.
We will hold that property #ForProduct to avoid profit and rent.
We will trade work early to avoid the usual problems of barter.
