A Product Ticket is proof of ownership (or maybe a commodity money) for a single, semi-fungible product instance.

Each Product Ticket may have a window of validity, such as a start and end time and other real-world constraints defined by the physical limitations of production.

Examples:
One 15 minute taxi ride between 8am and 8pm in the City of Plenty.  Good until Dec 2099.

One pint of Grade AA organic honey from hives at GPS location ____.  Pickup after Fall 2021.
