A Product Ticket is proof of ownership over a single product instance in a semi-fungible "serving size".

A Product Ticket may have a window of validity, such as a start time, end time and other real-world constraints defined by the physical limitations of production.

Examples:
15 minutes of taxi service between 8am and 8pm.  Good until Dec 2099.

One pint organic, grade AA honey.

One night at hotel or apartment with queen bed, kitchen.
