A Source Title is proof of ownership over physical Sources of production.

Each Source Title is a deed of property ownership over physical sources of production and implicit ownership of all future products created by those sources.

Source Titles are issued as fully unique (non-fungible), replaceable (semi-fungible), or universal (fungible) tokens.

The Earth Change DAO issues and sells Source Titles to buy the sources required for that production.
