The Earth Change Source Title is a deed of property ownership over the physical sources of production and implicit ownership of all future products created by those sources both held under terms of the For Product model.

The Earth Change DAO issues and sells Source Titles to buy the sources required for that production.

By convention, each Source Title is "backed by" (represents real property ownership in) 1 ftÂ² of land.

That land could be part of an orchard, restaurant, hotel, hospital, airport, or whatever it takes to supply that product.
