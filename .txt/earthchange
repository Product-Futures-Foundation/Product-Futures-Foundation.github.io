earthChange is a coin issued against land held under this contract.

To begin, users feed real-estate listings into the earthChange DAO.
The DAO issues 1 fungible earthChange coin for each ftÂ² of each parcel.
**THESE COINS DO NOT REPRESENT PROPERTY OWNERSHIP!  See: Source Titles**

The DAO auctions these coins to gather the funds to buy that land.
For each parcel, if the auction succeeds, that land is purchased.
The DAO temporarily holds Source Title ownership of those parcels.

The DAO issues Product Tickets and auctions them to achieve Future Production.
Users may pay for future production with money or by signing Work Agreements.

Users who pay with money do not gain Source Title ownership.
Users who complete Work Agreements gain Source Title ownership.

Owners may not sell Source Titles for money, not even for earthChange.
Owners may trade Source Titles for Work Agreement signatures or for other Source Titles.
