== Old Notes
=== Products
Each owner of Sources is owner of future Product in that same ratio.

For example, if you own 3% of the hives, you own 3% of the future honey.

Each Product instance has a window-of-validity in time enforced by constraints on production and on the lifetime of that product.

For example, a young tree does not produce fruit immediately, and the fruit is not fresh forever.

Property may not fully vest to workers if quality or quantity projections are not met.  Projections must be adjusted for reasons outside the worker‚Äôs control such as such as severe weather, fire, earthquake, accidents, etc.

=== Sources
Each owner must pay initial and recurring costs of production in one of these ways:
. Supply Sources or Promises for your portion of the costs of production for this group.
. Supply Sources or Promises for your portion of the costs of production through another group which has a trade agreement with this group, and recursively, to any depth.
. Sell (or allow to be sold) enough of your Product to cover the costs of production.
. Secede from the group and retain your portion of the sources under your own terms (within the limits of realistic divisibility).

A variety of city design templates following permaculture principles could help guide core decisions around borders, roads, shared structures, etc.

For the health and safety of all citizens, every citizen on site must receive at least enough tokens to ensure Tier0 quality of life.

===Promises
Promises are commitments of future work.

Work is auctioned with payout increasing as the crowdfund end date approaches.  So more difficult or less fun jobs receive higher pay.

Each group must insure every worker is qualified

ESTs purchased with work commitments vest incrementally, as that work is completed.

Trading work early in time, before production begins, allows us to specialize without passing tokens while also solving the ‚Äúsimultaneous coincidence of wants‚Äù problem that faces typical barter.

This creates a real and direct insurance for each good and service produced in this way and inverts the usual incentives of scarcity and destruction toward the natural goals of abundance and permanent solutions.

This contrasts with the regular market where mechanics, plumbers and dentists need customers with broken cars, pipes, teeth to insure tokens continue to flow.

When workers commit early to apply any work needed in the future, they hope you never have any trouble at all, since they have received your commitments either way.

Work is returned to it‚Äôs natural position as a problem to minimize instead of being a confused as goal itself.

Automation and robots can be used to safely reduce work in this scenario because each group only wants the results.

A guild system could train and test workers and protect owners by insuring quality levels and spreading fulfillment risks across many workers.

===Profit
Any owner may sell any amount of product at any price, but some percentage of that profit must be treated as the payer's investment by purchasing ESTs for that payer and giving those ESTs to that payer.

This safely reduces Profit within the system as the Sources required for production are incrementally redistributed to the consumers who need the results.


== Startup
Estimate the quantity and quality food, housing, sanitation, clothing, basic health-care, child care, transportation, etc. needed to support on-site workers.

Estimate the Sources and Skills needed for that production and issue ESTs representing those Sources.

Sell future Products for traditional money.

Sell ESTs for commitments of future work.

Part of the property must be the land, water, tools, organisms, lumber, wire, pipe, etc. required to create and operate the Earth Change city.

The rest must be 'bootup' goods such as tents, bulk-food, used clothing, first-aid kits, etc. needed to support workers until the agriculture is productive and before the permanent shelters are complete.

We may also need to secure commitments of some critical services that we cannot yet supply on-site such as advanced dental work, extended health care, long-distance travel, etc.

== Finance
Investment Types (3 ways to pay)
1. Pay with commitments of traditional money to crowdfund the debt-free
 purchase of real estate and tools from the regular market.

2. Pay with commitments to work in the future for others within the city.
 This cause you, the worker, to receive immediate access to enough
 ESTs to sustain at least Tier0 quality of life.
 Vesting occurs as promises are kept, causing all workers to gain
 debt-free housing and food security.

3. Pay in a sort of ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô way when you buy surplus product
 from other owners and pay more than the real costs of production.
 Owners selling surplus are required to buy ESTs with
 some of their profits, and vest ownership of those titles to you,
 the payer.

Potential users pre-pay to purchase land, water-rights, tools, plants, animals, etc. required to create basic goods and services they need such as food, shelter, cloth, soap, medicine, sanitation, basic health care including dentistry, optometry, etc.

Some pre-pay with traditional money buy the land and tools while others pre-pay by commiting to complete the needed work.

After some amount of time, or some series of events [these conditions are currently unknown] the ESTs should vest more fully to the payer, allowing him to eventually sell them or negotiate with other co-owners to rezone the property.

At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to secede (fork/split) from the group while retaining Property ownership.

Those investing Skills become real co-owners and so receive the Product itself as a natural return on those investments.  Each co-owner of Sources is co-owner of those Products in that same amount.

That leaves profit to be treated as the payer's investment in Sources which become the real property of that consumer, causing them to incrementally gain the Sources ownership required to finally stop buying that product late, but instead pay the costs early and then own the Product as a natural side-effect of owning the Sources.

This auto-distributes ownership to those who pay for growth.

Profit can be seen as misallocated property 'reflected' back to the buyer as Source ownership.  This must not be replaced by extra product lowered price, for such do not distribute Source ownership, and so fail to create the negative-feedback loop required to help consumers build sovereignty through property ownership in the physical Sources of production.

== Strategy
Attract middle-income Consumers to pre-pay for organic goods and services.

Use part of the funds to buy cheap agricultural land without mortgage.
Use part of the funds to buy tools, plants, animals, water rights.
Use part of the funds to buy 'startup' needs of workers such as tents, bulk food, used clothing, first-aid materials, etc.

Attract Workers to build and operate the infrastructure by providing a "Basic Outcome" that covers all of: housing, utilities, transportation, food, water, medicine, clothing, basic health care, child-care, education, - eventually all the things the current corporations and governments fail to achieve.

Occupy that land with tents to begin planting and building.
If we qualify as non-profit we might avoid Property taxes.

If you want the studio apartment, 3 minute showers, and very simple meals, you will not need to commit very much of your future labor.

If you want a 3-bedroom house, shares in the clubhouse and more elaborate meals, you will need to commit more of your future labor (or more valuable labor) in order to compensate others for the extra work and land and tools required for that production.

For example, if you like milk and honey, then you will eventually want co-ownership in cattle and bees and all other property such as land, barns, food crops, tools, etc. used to house and feed those organisms, and the things needed to create *those* inputs, recursively, through the entire tree of production.

Hybrid Option: Attract traditional Venture Capitalists, and pay them a % of profit when selling surplus.

== Workflow

Vision of a future product is proposed.

Engineering constraints are enforced to find a realistic implementation or variation.

The scale and level of vertical integration are estimated, balancing more immediate needs with longer term goals.

A 'recipe' for that production is written, listing the required Sources and Skills.

ESTs are issued, each representing a portion of those Sources.

Future products are then sold to purchase the real estate and tools and plants and animals on the open market.

ESTs are sold to workers to secure the needed Skills.

Once we have all the commitments of Sources and Skills, we can begin production.

After the first round of production, Products are distributed to each investor based on their percentage of ownership.

For example, "Dental Ensurance" requires co-ownership in the land and capital needed to perform dentistry combined with promises of future labor from a qualified Dentist to fix your teeth in return for you working on his behalf somewhere else in the city, or on behalf of somebody else who will work on his behalf, and so on, to any depth.

Promising to work *before* production begins allows us to trade Labor between ourselves and never need to trade oranges with apples, since the co-owner of sources is the owner of that % of product even *before* it is produced.  This is "Predictive Barter" - where sources and skills are used to preallocate products to those who will consume them.

A functional Earth Change system will require enough "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to 'pay' each other without needing to pass tokens.  For example, after we build a dentist office and buy the tools for simple dental procedures, we must attract or train some people that can operate those tools, and who are willing to commit to do that work for the 'pay' of gaining co-ownership in the property for housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate that property for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.  Notice this fully replaces traditional insurance.

Vertical Integration increases local sovereignty by reducing the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we might buy feed for our chickens and cattle at first, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.  We won't co-own mines or factories right away, so will just buy off-the-shelf tools while we are 'booting'.

=Notes
We use property ownership in the INPUTS to "pre-distribute" the OUTPUTS to those who predicted they would need them.

The usual transaction of consumer purchase is eliminated for those owners, for that product.  The price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as a co-owner and profit is undefined since the final sale does not occur - it has been imputed.

Each source owner is a product owner in that same amount.

Owners may sell surplus, and profit should be collected to inhibit middle-men, but some percentage of profit must be treated as that payer's investment to insure consumers gain the sources required to also escape usury.

To increase utilization, Product Tickets could be designed to automatically enter auction and be sold before expiration.

Each owner must periodically cross-commit the inputs required for the ongoing costs of production for all of the outputs they expect, else lose some of that ownership to compensate other co-owners for those costs.

For example, each co-owner of a dentist office must cross-commit Sources or Skills needed to keep the office operational.

This usually just means you will commit to work somewhere in the system to buy the products you need, with the DAO resolving all the details about the sources and skills required for that production.

Products that are not yet produced on-site must be purchased from external vendors while we also try to buy the sources of those products to vertically integrate and move closer toward productive sovereignty.

For example, we might buy feed for cattle and chickens at first,
but would also start growing those plants to localize that production.

The initial boot-up phase may require workers live in tents as they build the first permanent structures and prepare cafeteria meals from bulk purchases until the agriculture is productive enough.

We can eventually grow all the inputs required for food, soap, cloth, medicine, and building materials on site, but this could take years for some products so initially must buy off-the-shelf solutions for sanitation, shelter, food, clothing, first-aid, etc.

==Notes
ESTs sold at $1/ft¬≤ supply $43,650/acre to buy the land, tools and work (workers are paid with ESTs, never directly with $).
Instead of representation, governance is direct control through commitments of property or promises toward public works (parallel, semi-continuous crowdfunding campaigns).
