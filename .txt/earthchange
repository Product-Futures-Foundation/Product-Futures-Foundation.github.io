earthChange is a coin issued against land held under this contract.

To begin, users feed real-estate listings into the earthChange DAO.
The DAO issues 1 fungible earthChange coin for each ftÂ² of each parcel.
**THESE COINS DO NOT REPRESENT PROPERTY OWNERSHIP!  See: Source Titles**

The DAO auctions these coins to gather the funds to buy that land.
For each parcel, if the auction succeeds, that land is purchased.
The DAO temporarily holds Source Title ownership of the parcels.

Users may ask the DAO for Future Production.
Users may sign Work Agreements to 'pay' for future production.
The user does their best to describe what they understand.
If the engineering is unclear, other users may need to help.
If the supply-chain can be constructed, pre-sales can begin.
The DAO sells Product Tickets to achieve that Future Production.

There may be lower and upper limits on how much land you may own.
Users may become Source Title owners when they complete Work Agreements.
Owners must not sell Source Titles for money, not even for earthChange.
Owners may trade Source Titles for other Source Titles or for Work Agreement signatures.
