Sources are both the Material and ImMaterial inputs required for production.

Material Sources are mostly Finite things such as land, water, minerals, gases; and also the physical limitations when sharing, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, clean air and water, silence, and other externalities.

Immaterial Sources are mostly Infinite things such as computer source code (use of a computer language to describe an app), computer object code (the app), genetics, essentially all 'design' and metadesign.
