Product TicketðŸŽ« are issued as claims of ownership over future production at some projected quantity and quality.

We can sell Product TicketsðŸŽ« to buy the Sources required for that production
then mint Source Titlesâ–¦ and vest ownership as Work Agreements are fulfilled.

Most Product TicketsðŸŽ« have a natural "Window of Validity" as an approximate
start-time and end-time defined by the real limitations of production and storage.

For example, you might not redeem Avocado Product TicketsðŸ¥‘ for a decade or more.

Subscriptions can be thought of as a book of tickets.
