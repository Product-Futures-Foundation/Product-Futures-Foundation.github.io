Each Product Ticket represents a claim of ownership over the future production of a particular good or service at some projected quantity and quality.

Each Product Ticket is initially-invalid and finally expiring, with the "Window of Validity" defined by real limitations of production and storage.

During bootup, Product Tickets are issued and sold to buy the Sources required for that production.

After bootup, Product Tickets are periodically issued and deposited into the accounts of Source Title owners, representing the future products they *already* own.
