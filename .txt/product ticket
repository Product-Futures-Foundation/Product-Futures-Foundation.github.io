Product Tickets🎫 are claim over the projected quantity and quality of some future good or service.

Product Tickets🎫 represent OUTPUTS of production such as a shower 🚿, an apple 🍎, a taxi ride 🚕, theatre 🎭.

We can sell Product Tickets🎫 to buy the Sources required for that production,
then mint Source Titles▦ and vest ownership as Work Agreements are fulfilled.

Most Product Tickets🎫 have a natural "Window of Validity" as an approximate
start-time and end-time defined by the real limitations of production and storage.
