Thanks for asking for clarification.

I’m trying to express a set of economic “optimizations” which allow us to *pre-allocate* products to the users who actually need them, and so avoid the usual need to buy those things.

When we **Share Sources** and **Swap Skills** *before* that production is needed, we own those future goods and services without [purchase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_passing)!

We can enjoy efficiency-in-scale by owning productive assets in groups,  and specialization by exchanging work commitments early, to create a true insurance for any good or service and so regain control of the production we need.

A strategy for "Free as in Freedom" production.

    Source Ownership is used to pre-allocate future goods.
    Work Agreements are used to exchange future services.

1. Mint *expiring* "Product Tickets", each representing a single instance of a specific future good or service at some *projected* quality and quantity.

2. Auction these Product Tickets for the plain-old-money required to buy the "Sources" to produce those goods and services.  This is essentially just crowdfunding.
  >> Sources are finite things such as land, water, air, minerals, radio spectrum, etc.

3. Mint *permanent* "Source Titles" representing property ownership in those Sources.

4. Auction these Source Titles in exchange for "Skill Agreements" to secure the work required to produce the initial round of goods and services needed to payback the crowdfunders.
  >> Source Titles vest to workers as these "Skill Agreements" are completed.
  >> In an attempt to reduce speculation, it is suggested "Source Titles" never be sold for money, but must only change ownership through the completion of "Skill Agreements".  In other words, *you can only buy property with work*.

5. Provide interface to trade Skill Agreements and so enable work specialization.
   >> Once Sources and Skills are secured, future goods and services

6. Continue to mint Product Tickets representing future rounds-of-production and deposited them into the account of each Source Title owner.
  >> Product Tickets are only as 'valid' as the Sources and Skills

You can buy Shared Property such as Infrastructure such as roads, utilities, etc.
