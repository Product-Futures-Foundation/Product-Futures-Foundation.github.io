What about boring old problems like food and shelter?

We can own land to *avoid* paying rent.

We can own own 🐝s to make 🍯 almost free.

When consumers own the Means of Production,
they can accept the product itself as
the natural return on investment.

You do not buy that which you already own!

Profit is undefined
when product is ROI.

2019-10-27:
Imagine we issue NFT ▦, each representing a unique 1_ft² of real land (Token as Title) that can only be purchased (can only change owners) through the completion of “work agreements” (looking for a better term here - this needs to be a socially binding commitment to achieve future work).

Imagine another Semi-Fungible-Token 🎟 representing a projected future product (Token as Ticket).

The DAO issues and auctions 🎟 to buy the raw land and tools and other ingredients required to own and control the production we need.

In this way we might achieve better funding for public projects through private cities controlled by those citizen-owners using a direct-funding model to replace most of the usual tax+vote routine.

2019-10-25:
Mint Product Tickets🎟 and trade for money to buy the land.
Mint Source Titles ▦ and trade for future work commitments.

Each 🎟 represents a "serving size"
of some future good or service,
at a projected quantity and quality,
and usually with begin and expire date.

Each ▦ represents 1 square foot of real estate.

Who we are:
  We are Token Engineers, Social Strategists and Permaculture Practitioners changing how we fund, own and work to align ecology with economy to allow regenerative abundance without a conflict of value.

Fund: 👤→💰←🥑⇇🌳
Sell future products to fund sources without debt.  This is just rewards-based crowdfunding so we can buy land and tools without debt.

Work: 👤→👷←🥑+🌳
  Work to own product now and to own future sources without rent.  Workers receive a "Basic Outcome" of food and shelter and gain real property as that work is completed.

Own: 👤←🥑⇇🌳
  Own sources to own those products without purchase.  Owners accept the product itself as the natural ROI and so avoid profit to others.

Recurse: 👤→💰←🥑+🌳
  Buy surplus to own product now and to own future sources without rent.  Those who pay profit while buying surplus gain real property as those profits are invested for them.

User Interface
Define New Product: Document all Sources (land, tools, etc.) and Skills (human effort) required to create some quantity and quality of a Product (good or service).

Buy Future Product: Prepay for a Product with either money or Skills. 
Paying with Skills unassociated with that Product is limited by the trade-connections of that user.

Sell Future Product: Commit to apply Skills toward future Production.
If you try to commit a Skill you have not proven, the system shows the steps required to qualify for that job.

If we assume a 'fair' system
would have INPUTs equal OUTPUTs,

And if we use property
if we commit work
before production begins,
the flow of value cancels-out,
so few tokens need flow

food sovereignty MUST include housing.

Let us dare to own to occupy.

We will buy land for $1/ft²
to permanently quench rent!

"An organization or economic system where goods are produced
but *not* exchanged because property ownership in the Sources
caused those goods to be pre-allocated to those people who
need them, thereby 'imputing' the final sale of those goods
and causing profit to disappear in a puff of greasy smoke."

2019-10-09:
I have found something that looks like part of a solution...

Business is kinda like:
Sources (🌳: The INPUTS of production)
Actions (👷: Work such as planting 🌳 or harvesting 🥑)
Products (🥑: The OUTPUTS of production)
Profits (💰: If 🥑 is sold for a price *above* the real costs of production.)

With two separable stages:

Production: 🌳 + 👷 = 🥑
Sales: 🥑 ⇄ 💰

In traditional business, the INPUTS🌳 are owned by workers👷 or by random humans (shareholders).

Since the owners of INPUTS🌳 are automatically the owners of OUTPUTS🥑,
the OUTPUTS🥑 *must* be sold to consumers after they are produced.

But we could 'optimize' sales out of existence
by using property ownership over the INPUTS🌳 to
"pre-allocate" the OUTPUTS🥑 to those consumers.

This is done by building business where the
INPUTS🌳 are owned by the consumers because they want the OUTPUTS🥑,
and so accept the OUTPUTS🥑 as the 'natural' return on investment.

This removes the need to sell the finished OUTPUTS🥑
since they are *already* owned by the people who will consume them.

The price each of these special consumers pays
is simply the costs they each paid as a co-owner,
causing profit to be UNDEFINED since the transaction does not occur.

Even though there is no profit being collected by this business,
these special shareholders are happy because they were able to
*avoid* paying profit for those OUTPUTS🥑 they would have otherwise
paid if they had bought those OUTPUTS🥑 from another business.

The eC DAO sells "Future Product" subscriptions to host regenerative abundance.

eC can be whatever production you require or desire.
Taxes and votes are replaced by direct citizen-owner control.

Undeveloped land is often less than $1/ft².

Regenerative abundance starts with permaculture and natural building.
Permaculture imitates nature for environments that reintegrate humans.

Natural building uses local materials to create low-impact structures
respecting solar and lunar cycles through nearly motionless solutions.

The ingredients required to boot the pilot project:

Land (real estate), including all fees and taxes.

Water rights: Many variations on how this must be done.

Startup supplies: Tents, bedding, water filters, clothing, soap, etc.

Tools, supplies and skills to:
Collect heat from olar + compost + wood-chip stoves, etc.
Cook shared meals.
Make soap and other basic sanatation supplies.
Build composting toilets.
Install and care for flora, fauna and fungi as productive landscapes.

How we are different:
  We avoid paying rent, profit and interest by holding property For Product.

How we will get there:
  Sell future products to fund the sources of production.
    This means we will crowdfund the land and tools to begin.

  Vest source ownership to those who achieve that production.
    This means workers become owners as commitments are fulfilled.

  Use source ownership to own future products without purchase.
    This means members own land and tools because they need the results.

  Sell surplus products to fund the sources of production.
    This means extra goods and services are sold to buy more sources.

2019-10-02: The "For Product" business model rewrite:
1. Buy future products to fund the sources of production.
2. Gain source ownership as you produce those products.
3. Own sources to own future products without purchase.
4. Buy surplus products to fund the sources of production.
