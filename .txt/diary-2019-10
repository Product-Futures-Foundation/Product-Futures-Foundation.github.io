Who we are:
  We are Token Engineers, Social Strategists and Permaculture Practitioners changing how we fund, own and work to align ecology with economy to allow regenerative abundance without a conflict of value.

Fund: 👤→💰←🥑⇇🌳
Sell future products to fund sources without debt.  This is just rewards-based crowdfunding so we can buy land and tools without debt.

Work: 👤→👷←🥑+🌳
  Work to own product now and to own future sources without rent.  Workers receive a "Basic Outcome" of food and shelter and gain real property as that work is completed.

Own: 👤←🥑⇇🌳
  Own sources to own those products without purchase.  Owners accept the product itself as the natural ROI and so avoid profit to others.

Recurse: 👤→💰←🥑+🌳
  Buy surplus to own product now and to own future sources without rent.  Those who pay profit while buying surplus gain real property as those profits are invested for them.

User Interface
Define New Product: Document all Sources (land, tools, etc.) and Skills (human effort) required to create some quantity and quality of a Product (good or service).

Buy Future Product: Prepay for a Product with either money or Skills. 
Paying with Skills unassociated with that Product is limited by the trade-connections of that user.

Sell Future Product: Commit to apply Skills toward future Production.
If you try to commit a Skill you have not proven, the system shows the steps required to qualify for that job.

Source Wars: Conquest through Embargo
We promise future goods and services
to acquire the sources and skills
property and promises

If we assume a 'fair' system
would have INPUTs equal OUTPUTs,

And if we use property
if we commit work
before production begins,
the flow of value cancels-out,
so few tokens need flow

The talk of slums made me think again
food sovereignty MUST include housing.

Rent is 0 when owners occupy.
Let us dare to own to occupy.

We will buy land for $1/ft²
to permanently quench rent!

On embargos, tarrifs and trade agreements:
Invoking localized production chains
to create semi-sovereign nodes
on land acquired and governed

"An organization or economic system where goods are produced
but *not* exchanged because property ownership in the Sources
caused those goods to be pre-allocated to those people who
need them, thereby 'imputing' the final sale of those goods
and causing profit to disappear in a puff of greasy smoke."

2019-10-09:
I have found something that looks like part of a solution...

Business is kinda like:
Sources (🌳: The INPUTS of production)
Actions (👷: Work such as planting 🌳 or harvesting 🥑)
Products (🥑: The OUTPUTS of production)
Profits (💰: If 🥑 is sold for a price *above* the real costs of production.)

With two separable stages:

Production: 🌳 + 👷 = 🥑
Sales: 🥑 ⇄ 💰

In traditional business, the INPUTS🌳 are owned by workers👷 or by random humans (shareholders).

Since the owners of INPUTS🌳 are automatically the owners of OUTPUTS🥑,
the OUTPUTS🥑 *must* be sold to consumers after they are produced.

But we could 'optimize' sales out of existence
by using property ownership over the INPUTS🌳 to
"pre-allocate" the OUTPUTS🥑 to those consumers.

This is done by building business where the
INPUTS🌳 are owned by the consumers because they want the OUTPUTS🥑,
and so accept the OUTPUTS🥑 as the 'natural' return on investment.

This removes the need to sell the finished OUTPUTS🥑
since they are *already* owned by the people who will consume them.

The price each of these special consumers pays
is simply the costs they each paid as a co-owner,
causing profit to be UNDEFINED since the transaction does not occur.

Even though there is no profit being collected by this business,
these special shareholders are happy because they were able to
*avoid* paying profit for those OUTPUTS🥑 they would have otherwise
paid if they had bought those OUTPUTS🥑 from another business.

The eC DAO sells "Future Product" subscriptions to host regenerative abundance.

eC can be whatever production you require or desire.
Taxes and votes are replaced by direct citizen-owner control.

Undeveloped land is often less than $1/ft².

Regenerative abundance starts with permaculture and natural building.
Permaculture imitates nature for environments that reintegrate humans.

Natural building uses local materials to create low-impact structures
respecting solar and lunar cycles through nearly motionless solutions.

The ingredients required to boot the pilot project:

Land (real estate), including all fees and taxes.

Water rights: Many variations on how this must be done.

Startup supplies: Tents, bedding, water filters, clothing, soap, etc.

Tools, supplies and skills to:
Collect heat from olar + compost + wood-chip stoves, etc.
Cook shared meals.
Make soap and other basic sanatation supplies.
Build composting toilets.
Install and care for flora, fauna and fungi as productive landscapes.

How we are different:
  We avoid paying rent, profit and interest by holding property For Product.

How we will get there:
  Sell future products to fund the sources of production.
    This means we will crowdfund the land and tools to begin.

  Vest source ownership to those who achieve that production.
    This means workers become owners as commitments are fulfilled.

  Use source ownership to own future products without purchase.
    This means members own land and tools because they need the results.

  Sell surplus products to fund the sources of production.
    This means extra goods and services are sold to buy more sources.

Pass Howey Test by vesting source ownership only when paying with work, never when paying with money.

Pay with money to receive a single round of production like reward-based crowdfunding, or as a recurring subscription.

What we want: Permacultured private cities owned and operated by those citizens.
How we are different: The recently finalized For Product development model.
How we will get there:
  Sell future products to fund the sources of production.
    This means we will crowdfund the land and tools to begin.
  Vest source ownership to those who achieve that production.
    This means workers become owners as commitments are fulfilled.
  Use source ownership to own future products without purchase.
    This means members own land and tools because they need the results.
  Sell surplus products to fund the sources of production.
    This means extra goods and services are sold to buy more sources.

2019-10-02: The "For Product" business model rewrite:
1. Buy future products to fund the sources of production.
2. Gain source ownership as you produce those products.
3. Own sources to own future products without purchase.
4. Buy surplus products to fund the sources of production.
