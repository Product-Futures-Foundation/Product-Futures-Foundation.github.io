................................
    Wages chase rent,
 keeping workers in debt.

   Yet rent is zero,
 when consumer is owner,

   and every worker
    is a consumer!

 We can buy the property
 we need for production,

and trade work agreements
 in a For Product manner,

     to own future
   goods and services
 even before production,

and so solve the conflict
betwixt eaters and owners.
