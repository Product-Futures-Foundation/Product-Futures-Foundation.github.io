Work is not a need,
it is but a hurdle!

................................

        Wages chase rent,
     keeping workers in debt.

       Yet rent is zero,
     when consumer is owner.

         Every worker
      is also a consumer.

   So let's buy the property
     we need for production,

    and schedule the work
   in a For Product manner.
