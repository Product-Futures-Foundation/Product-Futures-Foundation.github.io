        Wages chase rent,
     keeping workers in debt.

       Yet rent is zero,
     when consumer is owner,

       and every worker
      is also a consumer!

   So let's buy the property
     we need for production,

      and schedule the work
      in a For Product manner.

      To escape the Usury
  by treating property properly.
