<br/>
<br/>
CityCoin is a claim over the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty and <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es required for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices.<br/>
<br/>
The CityCoin <a href="dao.htm">DAO</a> issues and <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>s CityCoin <a href="title.htm">Title</a>s to acquire <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s and <a href="work.htm">work</a> required to create a series of <a href="priva.htm">priva</a>te cities under the full <a href="control.htm">control</a> of those citizen <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Some users pay with plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y used to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s.<br/>
While others pay with commitments of <a href="work.htm">work</a> to create those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Terms of Operation</span><br/>
<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y becomes <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty: Consumers pay early to <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s for <a href="food.htm">food</a> and home.<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty becomes <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t: <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are consumers paying early for <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices.<br/>
<a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es become <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty: <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers become <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers as they complete <a href="work.htm">work</a> commitments.<br/>
Profit becomes <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty: Consumers pay late to <a href="own.htm">own</a> when they <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y becomes <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty</span><br/>
Similar to crowdfunding, consumers prepay for <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="good.htm">good</a>s and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices with plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, but instead of just receiving one round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, they become the real <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s that will be <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ased for that <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But this is also fundamentally different from equity-based crowdfunding because of the reason the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>+<a href="own.htm">own</a>er+consumer is taking a risk.<br/>
<br/>
Under this <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and consumers are one-and-the-same.<br/>
<br/>
They take risk to *avoid* paying the profit they would otherwise pay when attempting to <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from the regular market.<br/>
<br/>
This <small>(imperfectly)</small> ensures the <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and so acts as a more direct alternative to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional insurance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty becomes <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t</span><br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er accepts the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the direct and natural return on investment, thereby avoiding the usual <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing and <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ing of the finished com<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
The price each pays as a consumer is exactly the costs each paid as an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er while the final sale is eliminated, leaving profit undefined.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to another consumer, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has been pre-distributed to the consumer who predicted they would <a href="need.htm">need</a> it. There is no sale because it is already the individuated <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of that consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
This allows groups to operate at zero profit even while all share<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers remain satisfied. Notice the numeric compensation is approximately the same as a For Profit investment, but inverted in that the consumer avoids paying profit for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Subgroups must be allowed to secede from the majority when the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is realistically divisible to promote <a href="local.htm">local</a>ized <a href="control.htm">control</a> and inhibit Tyranny of the Majority.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====<a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es become <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty</span><br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers invest when they commit to achieve <a href="work.htm">work</a> within the city.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is guaranteed access to Tier0 in return for immediate access to some* CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s vesting as those <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es are completed, thereby avoiding excessive price and rent usually paid for <a href="food.htm">food</a> and <a href="hous.htm">hous</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is a consumer who must also <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty to <a href="control.htm">control</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts he must consume.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to accomplish <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="goal.htm">goal</a>s and receive <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty as those <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es are fulfilled. This replaces the rent or mortgage that would otherwise take most of the wages.<br/>
<br/>
Vested <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty can be used as collateral to access even more <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>able <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty under this <a href="work.htm">work</a>-to-<a href="own.htm">own</a> scheme.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Profit becomes <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty</span><br/>
Any <a href="own.htm">own</a>er may <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and even collect profit, but some of that profit must be invested for that very same paying user to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> newly issued CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s, or to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s being offered for sale by other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
This causes all users to incrementally gain the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership required to finally also <a href="control.htm">control</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion they <a href="need.htm">need</a> and receive those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts at cost.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Development Phases</span><br/>
PREBOOT<br/>
Search real estate listings to meet the many requirements such as: minimum size, maximum price, fitness for <a href="perm.htm">perm</a>aculture, zoning <a href="rest.htm">rest</a>rictions, <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights, mineral rights, taxes, fees, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Start crowdfunding pre-campaign to ask <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and other inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> where they p<a href="refer.htm">refer</a> to build.<br/>
<br/>
Finalize parcel selection and mint CityCoin against each <a href="squar.htm">squar</a>e foot.<br/>
<br/>
BOOT<br/>
Start real crowdfunding campaign to begin <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and other inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Reach <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment over general structure of the city such as a central meeting place, major roads, nature pre<a href="serv.htm">serv</a>es, strict <a href="border.htm">border</a>s, pollution <a href="rest.htm">rest</a>rictions, and any other constraints this group may decide to enforce upon itself.<br/>
<br/>
START<br/>
<a href="purch.htm">Purch</a>ase <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s and startup supplies, including primary bulk <a href="food.htm">food</a> ingredients such as bushels of grains, legumes, raw potatoes, bales of herbs and spices etc. to cook large, cheap but nutritious shared meals and begin soap and <a href="cloth.htm">cloth</a> making.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers may move onsite immediately, but may <a href="need.htm">need</a> to use tents, cafeteria style dining and temporary <a href="sani.htm">sani</a>tation facilities while the first shared structures are built and support <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ices are established.<br/>
<br/>
Build first shared structures and install quickly-maturing plants and animals primarily for initial <a href="food.htm">food</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
STASIS<br/>
&nbsp;The city can support Tier0 without external <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Begin building <a href="priva.htm">priva</a>te structures such as tiny <a href="hous.htm">hous</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Install slow-maturing plants and animals with uses beyond <a href="food.htm">food</a>.<br/>
<br/>
SOVEREIGN<br/>
&nbsp;The city can support Tier1 without external <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
SURPLUS<br/>
The city <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es more than it consumes.<br/>
<br/>
Investment Types <small>(3 ways to pay)</small><br/>
1. Pay with commitments of plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to crowdfund the <a href="debt.htm">debt</a>-free<br/>
&nbsp;<a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ase of real estate and <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s from the regular market.<br/>
<br/>
2. Pay with commitments to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the <a href="future.htm">future</a> for others within the city.<br/>
&nbsp;This cause you, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, to receive immediate access to enough<br/>
&nbsp;CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s to sustain at least Tier0 quality of life.<br/>
&nbsp;Vesting occurs as <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es are kept, causing all <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to gain<br/>
&nbsp;<a href="debt.htm">debt</a>-free <a href="hous.htm">hous</a>ing and <a href="food.htm">food</a> security.<br/>
<br/>
3. Pay in a sort of ‘accidental’ way when you <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;from other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and pay more than the real costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing surplus are required to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s with<br/>
&nbsp;some of their profits, and vest <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of those <a href="title.htm">title</a>s to you,<br/>
&nbsp;the payer. //<small>[<small>[How should we determine the minimum percentage?]</small>]</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">==== <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts</span><br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty is <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in that same ratio.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 3% of the hives, you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 3% of the <a href="future.htm">future</a> honey.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instance has a window-of-validity in <a href="time.htm">time</a> enforced by constraints on <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and on the life<a href="time.htm">time</a> of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a young tree does not <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e fruit immediately, and the fruit is not fresh forever.<br/>
<br/>
CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s issued to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers may not vest if quality or quantity projections are not met. Projections must be adjusted for reasons outside the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er’s <a href="control.htm">control</a> such as such as severe weather, fire, earthquake, accidents, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">==== <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty</span><br/>
A variety of city design templates following <a href="perm.htm">perm</a>aculture principles could help guide core decisions around <a href="border.htm">border</a>s, roads, shared structures, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The market price of each newly issued CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a> is based on:<br/>
1. The market price of the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
2. The market price of the <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This means those paying with plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y are implicitly also <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>ing *other* CityCoins used to compensate <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
For example, those paying with plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y for “1 Gallon of milk per month” must pay the market-price of the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="tool.htm">tool</a>s, cattle, <a href="water.htm">water</a> rights, etc., recursively, for all that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But that is only *part* of the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other cost is human <a href="labor.htm">labor</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So the CityCoin <a href="dao.htm">DAO</a> calculates the amount of human <a href="labor.htm">labor</a> required to build and operate a dairy <small>(or is fed this info by humans)</small> and then increases the <a href="sell.htm">sell</a>ing price to compensate those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers with their <a href="own.htm">own</a> CityCoins.<br/>
<br/>
This means CityCoins bought with plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y must be priced high enough to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and to also <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> *other* <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty which will vest to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers as they complete those <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The price of <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es is found through auction, increasing as each crowdfunding campaign end-date approaches.<br/>
<br/>
Each group must insure every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is qualified, especially for dangerous jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er must be able to commit the minimum <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es required to meet Tier0 quality of life else they cannot live onsite.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er must pay initial and recurring costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in one of these ways:<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Supply <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty or <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es for your portion of the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for this group.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Supply <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty or <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es for your portion of the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion through another group which has a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment with this group, and recursively, to any depth.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> <a href="sell.htm">Sell</a> <small>(or allow to be sold)</small> enough of your <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t to cover the costs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Secede from the group and retain your portion of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty under your <a href="own.htm">own</a> terms <small>(within the limits of realistic divisibility)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
For the safety of all citizens, every citizen must receive at least enough CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s to ensure Tier0 quality of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====<a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es</span><br/>
<a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es are commitments of <a href="future.htm">future</a> <a href="labor.htm">labor</a> which are <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed for <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty under these terms, or for <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es from others to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for you in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you might commit to pick fruit in the orchard during harvest season, drive a bus during the week, and cook breakfast every other Sunday at one of the many <a href="rest.htm">rest</a>aurants.<br/>
<br/>
When CityCoin is <a href="purch.htm">purch</a>ased with <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es, it vests incrementally, as that <a href="work.htm">work</a> is completed.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a> early in <a href="time.htm">time</a>, before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins, allows us to specialize without passing <a href="token.htm">token</a>s while also solving the “simultaneous coincidence of wants” problem that faces typical barter.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a real and direct insurance for each <a href="good.htm">good</a> and <a href="serv.htm">serv</a>ice <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in this way and inverts the usual incentives of scarcity and destruction toward our natural and original <a href="goal.htm">goal</a>s of abundance and <a href="perm.htm">perm</a>anent <a href="solu.htm">solu</a>tions.<br/>
<br/>
In the regular market, mechanics, plumbers and dentists <a href="need.htm">need</a> customers with broken cars, pipes, teeth to insure the <a href="token.htm">token</a>s continue to flow. But if those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can instead commit “up front” to fix any trouble that might occur in the <a href="future.htm">future</a>, they then hope you never have any trouble at all, since they have received your commitments either way.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="auto.htm">Auto</a>mation and <a href="robo.htm">robo</a>ts can be used to safely reduce <a href="work.htm">work</a> in this scenario because each group only wants the results.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a> is returned to it’s natural position as a problem we want to minimize instead of being a confused as social <a href="goal.htm">goal</a> itself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone may apply for any job, but <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> must proven and each group may enforce any other arbitrary requirements.<br/>
<br/>
A guild system might help determine <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> levels and offer free access to educational media and paid apprenticeships. Guilds would protect <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers by spreading quality and fulfillment risks across groups of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The job auction code <a href="need.htm">need</a>s to be written…<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Profit</span><br/>
Any <a href="own.htm">own</a>er may <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> any amount of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t at any price, but some percentage of that Profit must be treated as an investment from that payer into issuing more CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s, or to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a> CityCoin <a href="title.htm">title</a>s from others.<br/>
<br/>
This safely reduces Profit within the system as the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty required <a href="for product.htm">for product</a>ion is incrementally redistributed t<br/>
