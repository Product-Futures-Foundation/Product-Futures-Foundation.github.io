In addition to tying together elements of the theory of each of these three <a href="area.htm">area</a>s, our analysis casts <a href="new.htm">new</a> light on and has implications for a variety of issues in the professional and popular literature including the de<a href="fini.htm">fini</a>tion of the firm, the “separation of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and <a href="control.htm">control</a>,” the “social responsibility” of business, the de<a href="fini.htm">fini</a>tion of a “corporate objective <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ction,” the determination of an optimal <a href="capital.htm">capital</a> <a href="struc.htm">struc</a>ture, the specification of the content of <a href="cred.htm">cred</a>it <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ments, the theory of <a href="org.htm">org</a>anizations, and the supply side of the completeness of markets problems.<br/>

They are also not ex<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>eable for any <a href="mean.htm">mean</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, hence they are not transmutable into <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Such a system is proposed by many as a re<a href="plac.htm">plac</a>ement for <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y while retaining&nbsp;&nbsp;a system of remuneration for <a href="work.htm">work</a> done.<br/>
<br/>
The follo<a href="we.htm">we</a>rs of O<a href="we.htm">we</a>n stood for a society of co-operative communities. Each community would <a href="own.htm">own</a> its <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="mean.htm">mean</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and each member of a community would <a href="work.htm">work</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e what had <a href="bee.htm">bee</a>n <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d was <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed and in return would be issued with a labour voucher <a href="cert.htm">cert</a>ifying for how many hours he or she had <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed. A person could then <a href="use.htm">use</a> this labour voucher to obtain from the community's stock of consumer <a href="good.htm">good</a>s any <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts which had taken the same number of hours to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
O<a href="we.htm">we</a>n believed that this co-operative common<a href="we.htm">we</a>alth could begin to be introduced under <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ism and in the first half of the 1830s some of his follo<a href="we.htm">we</a>rs established labour bazaars on a similar principle in which <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers brought the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of their labour to the bazaar and received in ex<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e a labour voucher that en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d them to take from the bazaar any item or items which had taken the same <a href="time.htm">time</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e after taking into account the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of the raw <a href="mater.htm">mater</a>ials. These bazaars<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re ultimately failures, but the idea of labour vouchers appeared in substantially similar forms in France in the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.<small>[citation <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed]</small><br/>
<br/>
Although he dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d with the manner in which they<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re implemented by O<a href="we.htm">we</a>n, they<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re later advocated by Karl Marx as a way of dealing with immediate and temporary shortages upon the establishment of socialism. Marx explained that this would be necessary since socialism emerges from <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ism and would be "stamped with its birthmarks". In Marx's proposal, an early socialist society would reward its citizens according to the amount of labour they contribute to society. In the Critique of the Gotha Programme, Marx said:<br/>
<br/>
<small>[T]</small>he individual <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er receives back from society—after the deductions have <a href="bee.htm">bee</a>n made—ex<a href="act.htm">act</a>ly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labour. For example, the social <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing day consists of the sum of the individual hours of <a href="work.htm">work</a>; the individual labour <a href="time.htm">time</a> of the individual <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er is the part of the social <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing day contributed by him, his <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e in it. He receives a <a href="cert.htm">cert</a>ificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labour <small>(after deducting his labour for the common <a href="fun.htm">fun</a>ds)</small>; and with this <a href="cert.htm">cert</a>ificate, he draws from the social stock of <a href="mean.htm">mean</a>s of consumption as much as the same amount of labour <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>. The same amount of <a href="labor.htm">labor</a> which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.<small>[3]</small><br/>
<br/>
Ho<a href="we.htm">we</a>ver, Marx essentially ref<a href="use.htm">use</a>d the idea in the Poverty of Philosophy, especially within the <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ism <small>(I. chapter, 2. §)</small>. Marx <a href="state.htm">state</a>d that the <a href="time.htm">time</a> in itself separated from other people's <a href="time.htm">time</a> is not s<a href="ui.htm">ui</a>table to measure the <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e of <a href="work.htm">work</a>. The <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>e "is constituted, not by the <a href="time.htm">time</a> <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it by itself, but in relation to the quota of each and every other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t which can be <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>ed at the same <a href="time.htm">time</a>" <small>(3.§. A.)</small>. According to Marx, the introduction of labour vouchers would <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e a lazy society and <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy as there would not be concurrency bet<a href="we.htm">we</a>en employers and employees, so nobody would be able to tell what the optimal <small>(minimal)</small> <a href="time.htm">time</a> which was <a href="need.htm">need</a>ed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e some<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> would be. For example, what if "Peter" <a href="work.htm">work</a>s 12 hours per day, <a href="mean.htm">mean</a>while "Paul" <a href="work.htm">work</a>s only 6 hours. This <a href="mean.htm">mean</a>s that "Peter" <a href="work.htm">work</a>ed 6 unnecessary hours and his labour vouchers are not worth any<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> as this is regarded +6 hours, not to mention other f<a href="act.htm">act</a>ors of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>. To summarize Marx's opinion in the Poverty of Philosophy, the labour voucher is not s<a href="ui.htm">ui</a>table to <a href="creat.htm">creat</a>e a <a href="new.htm">new</a> socialist society, and the theory of Proudhon and others is no<a href="thing.htm">thing</a> more than a utopian apology of the existing <a href="capital.htm">capital</a>ist system. By Friedrich Engels, Proudhon himself tried to introduce the labour voucher system in 1849, but his attempt collapsed soon. Marx was adamant in saying that labour vouchers<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re not a form of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y as they could not circulate—a problem he pointed out with O<a href="we.htm">we</a>n's system of labour-<a href="time.htm">time</a> notes.<br/>
<br/>
After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re forced to let the direct <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion-ex<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>e and gave <a href="valu.htm">valu</a>eless vouchers to the peasantry for the grain and the <a href="food.htm">food</a>-stuff which<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re confiscated by brutal force, but this method led to <a href="local.htm">local</a> rebellions and after all to the civil war. Vladimir Lenin never suggested introducing the labour voucher system in the industrial <a href="area.htm">area</a>s. No other socialist countries <a href="use.htm">use</a>d later the labour voucher system.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Leo Chiozza <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y advocated for a similar <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary scheme in his 1934 book <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y <small>(Methuen)</small> with notes or <a href="cert.htm">cert</a>ificates being issued <a href="for product.htm">for product</a>ive <a href="work.htm">work</a> and destroyed once ex<a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed for consumption <a href="good.htm">good</a>s. In Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler <small>(Hjalmar Schacht finance-minister and banker)</small> applied a kind of labour-voucher named MEFO-bond, whose aim was to hide the rearmament program's expenditures before the<a href="we.htm"> We</a>stern world as the big t<a href="rust.htm">rust</a>s did not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> by <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y-transfer to each other, but bought MEFO bonds from the <a href="state.htm">state</a> and <a href="chang.htm">chang</a>ed these bonds in closed circ<a href="ui.htm">ui</a>t. More <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern implementations as <a href="time.htm">time</a>-based currencies<a href="we.htm"> we</a>re implemented in the United <a href="state.htm">State</a>s starting in the 1970s.<br/>
