<p class='main'><hr/><span class="date">2020-01-18:</span> Phone app idea for "<a href="chat.htm">chat</a> <a href="bot.htm">bot</a>s" that continuously listen to the conversation in the room and talk as though they were there without prompting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Alexa or Siri, but instead of <a href="need.htm">need</a>ing to ask them directly, they offer advice at their <a href="own.htm">own</a> discretion.<br/>
<br/>
Various personalities such as Mr. Know it all, Drunk Bastard, Silly Simon, Lying Larry, Grum<a href="py.htm">py </a>Grampa, Nosey Grandma, ... each trying to be helpful in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> way.<br/>
<br/>
I really want the Nosey Grandma to help me when driving since the Maps app is terrible at letting me know what is coming up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want her to be like "You better get over, the offramp is in half a mile!".<br/>

We have <a href="bee.htm">bee</a>n taught the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers must be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, but maybe that teaching is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of the baker <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the bakery, the miller <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the mill, and the <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>er <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>,<br/>
imagine the people who <a href="act.htm">act</a>ually <a href="need.htm">need</a> the bread <a href="own.htm">own</a> the bakery, mill and <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumers of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a> the Means of that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and<br/>
Accept the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the return on that inv<a href="est.htm">est</a>ment,<br/>
there is no <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="sell.htm">sell</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, for it is already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those who will consume it!<br/>
<br/>
This special arrangements eliminates the usual <a href="need.htm">need</a> to <a href="buy.htm">buy</a>/<a href="sell.htm">sell</a> that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and so eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in a natural way leaving those special <a href="shar.htm">shar</a>e<a href="hold.htm">hold</a>ers hap<a href="py.htm">py </a>that they were able to <a href="avo.htm">avo</a>id <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> they would have otherwise paid if they had bought that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from the market.<br/>
<br/>
This also prepares us for <a href="robo.htm">robo</a>ts that will soon be able to plant and harv<a href="est.htm">est</a> :ear_of_rice:, transport, grind, mix and bake the :bread: with almost no human intervention.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers can <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="farm.htm">farm</a>s and f<a href="act.htm">act</a>ories and wells and refineries for the insane reason that we simply <a href="need.htm">need</a> the results, instead of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing for the tired <a href="game.htm">game</a> of attempting to overcharge each other.<br/>
<br/>
We, as consumers, already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(and even more when we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>, so it is easy to see we can afford to be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers once we realize the dream of <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership was an accidental or purposeful misdirection on our road to <a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion!<br/>
